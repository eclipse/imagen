     *       display the image.  TILE_THRESH is a tunable parameter.
     *
     *    2) If the overlap area between the previous and current display windows
     *       is a small fraction (AREA_THRESH) of the combined previous and new
     *       display areas, then add tiles to this nodes reservoir to cover the
     *       display plus a WINDOW_CORONA (also tunable) around the edges.
     *
     * If <code>setWindow</code> were to simply do nothing and return, then the JAI
     * pull mechanism would handle updates but it wouldn't add the corona tiles around
     * the display and it would add useless overhead.
