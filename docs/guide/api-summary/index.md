* Contents

## B.1 Java AWT Imaging

[Table B-1](#table-B-1) lists and describes the `java.awt` imaging classes.

**Table B-1 `java.awt` Imaging Classes** <name="table-B-1"></a>

| Class | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Image | The superclass of all classes that represent graphical images. |


## B.2 Java 2D Imaging

The Java 2D API is a set of classes for advanced 2D graphics and
imaging. It encompasses line art, text, and images in a single
comprehensive model. The API provides extensive support for image
compositing and alpha channel images, a set of classes to provide
accurate color space definition and conversion, and a rich set of
display-oriented imaging operators.

The Java 2D classes are provided as additions to the `java.awt` and
`java.awt.image` packages (rather than as a separate package).

### B.2.1 Java 2D Imaging Interfaces

[Table B-2](#table-B-2) lists and briefly describes
the imaging interfaces defined in the `java.awt.image `(Java 2D) API.

**Table B-2 `java.awt.image` Interfaces** <a name="table-B-2"></a>

| Interface | Description |
| --------- | ------------|
| BufferedImageOp | Describes single-input/single-output operations performed on BufferedImage objects. This is implemented by such classes as `AffineTransformOp`, `ConvolveOp`, `BandCombineOp`, and `LookupOp`. |
| ImageConsumer | Used for objects expressing interest in image data through the ImageProducer interfaces. |
| ImageObserver | Receives notifications about Image information as the Image is constructed. |
| ImageProducer | Used for objects that can produce the image data for Images. Each image contains an ImageProducer that is used to reconstruct the image whenever it is needed, for example, when a new size of the Image is scaled, or when the width or height of the Image is being requested. |
| ImagingLib | Provides a hook to access platform-specific imaging code. |
| RasterImageConsumer | Extends: ImageConsumer <br/> The interface for objects expressing interest in image data through the `ImageProducer` interfaces. When a consumer is added to an image producer, the producer delivers all of the data about the image using the method calls defined in this interface. |
| RasterOp | Describes single-input/single-output operations performed on `Raster` objects. This is implemented by such classes as `AffineTransformOp`, `ConvolveOp`, and `LookupOp`. |
| RenderedImage | A common interface for objects that contain or can produce image data in the form of Rasters. |
| TileChangeListener | An interface for objects that wish to be informed when tiles of a `WritableRenderedImage` become modifiable by some writer via a call to getWritableTile, and when they become unmodifiable via the last call to releaseWritableTile. |
| WriteableRenderedImage | Extends: RenderedImage </br> A common interface for objects that contain or can produce image data that can be modified and/or written over. |

| RGBImageFilter | Extends: `ImageFilter` <br/> Provides an easy way to create an ImageFilter that modifies the pixels of an image in the default RGB ColorModel. It is meant to be used in conjunction with a FilteredImageSource object to produce filtered versions of existing images. |
| Raster | Represents a rectanglular array of pixels and provides methods for retrieving image data. It contains a DataBuffer object that holds a buffer of image data in some format, a SampleModel that describes the format is capable of storing and retrieving Samples from the DataBuffer, and a Rect that defines the coordinate space of the raster (upper left corner, width and height). |
| ReplicateScaleFilter | Extends: `ImageFilter` <br/> Scales images using the simplest algorithm. |

| ShortLookupTable | Extends: `LookupTable` <br/>  Defines a lookup table object. The lookup table contains short data for one or more tile channels or image components (for example, separate arrays for R, G, and B), and it contains an offset that will be subtracted from the input value before indexing the array. |
| SinglePixelPackedSample-Model | Extends: `SampleModel` <br/> Stores (packs) the N samples that make up a single pixel in one data array element. All data array elements reside in the first bank of a DataBuffer. |
