# 9.1 Introduction

The ImageN API image analysis operators are used to directly or
indirectly extract information from an image. The ImageN API supports the
following image analysis functions:

-   Finding the mean value of an image region
-   Finding the minimum and maximum values in an image (extrema)
-   Producing a histogram of an image
-   Detecting edges in an image
-   Performing statistical operations

# 9.2 Finding the Mean Value of an Image Region

The `Mean` operation scans a specified region of an image and computes
the image-wise mean pixel value for each band within the region. The
region of interest does not have to be a rectangle. If no region is
specified (null), the entire image is scanned to generate the
histogram. The image data pass through the operation unchanged.

The `mean` operation takes one rendered source image and three
parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| roi | ROI | The region of the image to scan. A null value means the whole image. |
| xPeriod | Integer | The horizontal sampling rate. May not be less than 1. |
| yPeriod | Integer | The vertical sampling rate. May not be less than 1. |

The region of interest (ROI) does not have to be a rectangle. It may
be `null`, in which case the entire image is scanned to find the
image-wise mean pixel value for each band.

The set of pixels scanned may be reduced by specifying the `xPeriod`
and `yPeriod` parameters, which define the sampling rate along each
axis. These variables may not be less than 1. However, they may be
`null`, in which case the sampling rate is set to 1; that is, every
pixel in the ROI is processed.

The image-wise mean pixel value for each band may be retrieved by
calling the `getProperty` method with `"mean"` as the property name.
The return value has type `java.lang.Number[#bands]`.

[Listing 9-1](#listing-9-1) shows a partial code sample of
finding the image-wise mean pixel value of an image in the rendered
mode.

***Listing 9-1*  Finding the Mean Value of an Image Region** <a name="listing-9-1"></a>

```java
// Set up the parameter block for the source image and
// the three parameters.
ParameterBlock pb = new ParameterBlock();
pb.addSource(im);   // The source image
pb.add(null);       // null ROI means whole image
pb.add(1);          // check every pixel horizontally
pb.add(1);          // check every pixel vertically

// Perform the mean operation on the source image.
RenderedImage meanImage = JAI.create("mean", pb, null);

// Retrieve and report the mean pixel value.
double[] mean = (double[])meanImage.getProperty("mean");
System.out.println("Band 0 mean = " + mean[0]);
```

# 9.3 Finding the Extrema of an Image

The `Extrema` operation scans a specific region of a rendered image
and finds the image-wise minimum and maximum pixel values for each
band within that region of the image. The image pixel data values pass
through the operation unchanged. The `extrema` operation can be used
to obtain information to compute the scale and offset factors for the
amplitude rescaling operation (see [Section 7.4, \"Amplitude
Rescaling](image-enhance/index.html)\").

The region-wise maximum and minimum pixel values may be obtained as
properties. Calling the `getProperty` method on this operation with
`"extrema"` as the property name retrieves both the region-wise
maximum and minimum pixel values. Calling it with `"maximum"` as the
property name retrieves the region-wise maximum pixel value, and with
`"minimum"` as the property name retrieves the region-wise minimum
pixel value.

The return value for `extrema` has type `double[2][#bands]`, and those
for `maximum` and `minimum` have type `double[#bands]`.

The region of interest (ROI) does not have to be a rectangle. It may
be `null`, in which case the entire image is scanned to find the
image-wise maximum and minimum pixel values for each band.

The `extrema` operation takes one rendered source image and three
parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| roi | ROI | The region of the image to scan. |
| xPeriod | Integer | The horizontal sampling rate (may not be less than 1). |
| yPeriod | Integer | The vertical sampling rate (may not be less than 1). |

The set of pixels scanned may be further reduced by specifying the
`xPeriod` and `yPeriod` parameters that represent the sampling rate
along each axis. These variables may not be less than 1. However, they
may be `null`, in which case the sampling rate is set to 1; that is,
every pixel in the ROI is processed.

[Listing 9-2](#listing-9-2) shows a partial code sample of
using the `extrema` operation to obtain both the image-wise maximum
and minimum pixel values of the source image.

***Listing 9-2*  Finding the Extrema of an Image*  <a name="listing-9-2"></a>

```java
// Set up the parameter block for the source image and
// the constants
ParameterBlock pb = new ParameterBlock();
pb.addSource(im);   // The source image
pb.add(roi);        // The region of the image to scan
pb.add(50);         // The horizontal sampling rate
pb.add(50);         // The vertical sampling rate

// Perform the extrema operation on the source image
RenderedOp op = JAI.create("extrema", pb);

// Retrieve both the maximum and minimum pixel value
double[][] extrema = (double[][]) op.getProperty("extrema");
```

# 9.4 Histogram Generation

An image histogram is an analytic tool used to measure the amplitude
distribution of pixels within an image. For example, a histogram can
be used to provide a count of the number of pixels at amplitude 0, the
number at amplitude 1, and so on. By analyzing the distribution of
pixel amplitudes, you can gain some information about the visual
appearance of an image. A high-contrast image contains a wide
distribution of pixel counts covering the entire amplitude range. A
low contrast image has most of the pixel amplitudes congregated in a
relatively narrow range.

Usually, the wider histogram represents a more visually-appealing
image.

***Figure 9-1*  Example Histograms** <a name="figure-9-1"></a>

The primary tasks needed to perform a histogram operation are as
follows:

1. Create a `Histogram` object, which specifies the type of histogram to
be generated.

2. Create a `Histogram` operation with the required parameters or create
a `ParameterBlock` with the parameters and pass it to the `Histogram`
operation.

3. Read the histogram data stored in the object. The data consists of:

   - Number of bands in the histogram
   - Number of bins for each band of the image
   - Lowest value checked for each band
   - Highest value checked for each band

### 9.4.1 Specifying the Histogram

The `Histogram` object accumulates the histogram information. A
histogram counts the number of image samples whose values lie within a
given range of values, or \"bins.\" The source image may be of any
data type.

The `Histogram` contains a set of bins for each band of the image.
These bins hold the information about gray or color levels. For
example, to take the histogram of an eight-bit grayscale image, the
`Histogram` might contain 256 bins. When reading the `Histogram`, bin
0 will contain the number of 0\'s in the image, bin 1 will contain the
number of 1\'s, and so on.

The `Histogram` need not contain a bin for every possible value in the
image. It is possible to specify the lowest and highest values that
will result in a bin count being incremented. It is also possible to
specify fewer bins than the number of levels being checked. In this
case, each bin will hold the count for a range of values. For example,
for a `Histogram` with only four bins used with an 8-bit grayscale
image, the number of occurrences of values 0 through 63 will be stored
in bin 0, occurrences of values 64 through 127 will be stored in bin
1, and so on.

The `Histogram` object takes three parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| numBins | int\[\] | Each element specifies the number of bins to be used for one band of the image. The number of elements in the array must match the number of bands in the image.
| lowValue | float\[\] | Each element specifies the lowest gray or color level that will be checked for in one band of the image. The number of elements in the array must match the number of bands in the image.
| highValue |float\[\] | Each element specifies the highest gray or color level that will be checked for in one band of the image. The number of elements in the array must match the number of bands in the image.

For an example histogram, see [Listing 9-3](#lsiting-9-3).

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.Histogram`

* `Histogram(int[] numBins, float[] lowValue, float[] highValue)`

### 9.4.2 Performing the Histogram Operation

Once you have created the `Histogram` object to accumulate the
histogram information, you generate the histogram for an image with
the `histogram` operation. The `histogram` operation scans a specified
region of an image and generates a histogram based on the pixel values
within that region of the image. The region of interest does not have
to be a rectangle. If no region is specified (null), the entire image
is scanned to generate the histogram. The image data passes through
the operation unchanged.

The `histogram` operation takes one rendered source image and four
parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| specification | Histogram | The specification for the type of histogram to be generated. See [Section 9.4.1](#941-specifying-the-histogram) |
| roi | ROI | The region of the image to scan. See [Section 6.2](../image-manipulation/#62-region-of-interest-control). |
| xPeriod | Integer | The horizontal sampling rate. May not be less than 1. |
| yPeriod | Integer | The vertical sampling rate. May not be less than 1. |

The set of pixels scanned may be further reduced by specifying the
`xPeriod` and `yPeriod` parameters that represent the sampling rate
along each axis. These variables may not be less than 1. However, they
may be null, in which case the sampling rate is set to 1; that is,
every pixel in the ROI is processed.

### 9.4.3 Reading the Histogram Data

The histogram data is stored in the user supplied `Histogram` object,
and may be retrieved by calling the `getProperty` method on this
operation with `"histogram"` as the property name. The return value
will be of type `Histogram`.

Several get methods allow you to check on the four histogram
parameters:

-   The bin data for all bands (`getBins`)``

-   The bin data for a specified band (`getBins`)

-   The number of pixel values found in a given bin for a given band
    (`getBinSize`)

-   The lowest pixel value found in a given bin for a given band
    (`getBinLowValue`)

The set of pixels counted in the histogram may be limited by the use
of a region of interest (ROI), and by horizontal and vertical
subsampling factors. These factors allow the accuracy of the histogram
to be traded for speed of computation.

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.Histogram`

* `int[][] getBins()`
* `int[] getBins(int band)`
* `int getBinSize(int band, int bin)`
* `float getBinLowValue(int band, int bin)`
* `void clearHistogram()`

* `void countPixels(java.awt.image.Raster pixels, ROI roi,
           int xStart, int yStart, int xPeriod, int yPeriod)`

### 9.4.4 Histogram Operation Example

[Listing 9-3](#listing-9-3) shows a sample listing for a histogram operation on a three-banded source image.

***Listing 9-3*  Example Histogram Operation** <a name="listing-9-3"></a>

```java
// Set up the parameters for the Histogram object.
int[] bins = {256, 256, 256};             // The number of bins.
double[] low = {0.0D, 0.0D, 0.0D};        // The low value.
double[] high = {256.0D, 256.0D, 256.0D}; // The high value.

// Construct the Histogram object.
Histogram hist = new Histogram(bins, low, high);

// Create the parameter block.
ParameterBlock pb = new ParameterBlock();
pb.addSource(image);               // Specify the source image
pb.add(hist);                      // Specify the histogram
pb.add(null);                      // No ROI
pb.add(1);                         // Sampling
pb.add(1);                         // periods

// Perform the histogram operation.
dst = (PlanarImage)JAI.create("histogram", pb, null);

// Retrieve the histogram data.
hist = (Histogram) dst.getProperty("histogram");

// Print 3-band histogram.
for (int i=0; i< histogram.getNumBins(); i++) {
   System.out.println(hist.getBinSize(0, i) + " " +
                      hist.getBinSize(1, i) + " " +
                      hist.getBinSize(2, i) + " " +
}
```

# 9.5 Edge Detection

Edge detection is useful for locating the boundaries of objects within
an image. Any abrupt change in image frequency over a relatively small
area within an image is defined as an edge. Image edges usually occur
at the boundaries of objects within an image, where the amplitude of
the object abruptly changes to the amplitude of the background or
another object.

The `GradientMagnitude` operation is an edge detector that computes
the magnitude of the image gradient vector in two orthogonal
directions. This operation is used to improve an image by showing the
directional information only for those pixels that have a strong
magnitude for the brightness gradient.

-   It performs two convolution operations on the source image. One
    convolution detects edges in one direction, the other convolution
    detects edges the orthogonal direction. These two convolutions
    yield two intermediate images.


-   It squares all the pixel values in the two intermediate images,
    yielding two more intermediate images.


-   It takes the square root of the last two images forming the final
    image.

The result of the `GradientMagnitude` operation may be defined as:

![](Analysis.doc.ancA3.gif)

where `SH(x,y,b)` and `SV(x,y,b)` are the horizontal and vertical
gradient images generated from band *b* of the source image by
correlating it with the supplied orthogonal (horizontal and
vertical) gradient masks.

The `GradientMagnitude` operation uses two gradient masks; one for
passing over the image in each direction. The `GradientMagnitude`
operation takes one rendered source image and two parameters.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| mask1 | KernelJAI | A gradient mask. |
| mask2 | KernelJAI | A gradient mask orthogonal to the first one. |

The default masks for the `GradientMagnitude` operation are:

- `KernelJAI.GRADIENT_MASK_SOBEL_HORIZONTAL`
- `KernelJAI.GRADIENT_MASK_SOBEL_VERTICAL`

These masks, shown in [Figure 9-2](#figure-9-2) perform
the Sobel edge enhancement operation. The Sobel operation extracts all
of the edges in an image, regardless of the direction. The resulting
image appears as an omnidirectional outline of the objects in the
original image. Constant brightness regions are highlighted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Figure 9-2*  Sobel Edge Enhancement Masks**

The Roberts\' cross edge enhancement operation uses the two masks
shown in [Figure 9-3](analysis/index.html). This operation
extracts edges in an image by taking the combined differences of
directions at right angles to each other to determine the gradient.
The resulting image appears as a fairly-coarse directional outline of
the objects within the image. Constant brightness regions become black
and changing brightness regions become highlighted. The following is a
listing of how the two masks are constructed.

```java
float[] roberts_h_data        = { 0.0F,  0.0F, -1.0F,
                                  0.0F,  1.0F,  0.0F,
                                  0.0F,  0.0F,  0.0F
};
float[] roberts_v_data        = {-1.0F,  0.0F,  0.0F,
                                  0.0F,  1.0F,  0.0F,
                                  0.0F,  0.0F,  0.0F
};

KernelJAI kern_h = new KernelJAI(3,3,roberts_h_data);
KernelJAI kern_v = new KernelJAI(3,3,roberts_v_data);
```

***Figure 9-3*  Roberts\' Cross Edge Enhancement Masks**

The Prewitt gradient edge enhancement operation uses the two masks
shown in [Figure 9-4](analysis/index.html). This operation
extracts the north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest,
west, or northwest edges in an image. The resulting image appears as a
directional outline of the objects within the image. Constant
brightness regions become black and changing brightness regions become
highlighted. The following is a listing of how the two masks are
constructed.

```java
float[] prewitt_h_data        = { 1.0F,  0.0F, -1.0F,
                                  1.0F,  0.0F, -1.0F,
                                  1.0F,  0.0F, -1.0F
};
float[] prewitt_v_data        = {-1.0F, -1.0F, -1.0F,
                                  0.0F,  0.0F,  0.0F,
                                  1.0F,  1.0F,  1.0F
};

KernelJAI kern_h = new KernelJAI(3,3,prewitt_h_data);
KernelJAI kern_v = new KernelJAI(3,3,prewitt_v_data);
```

***Figure 9-4*  Prewitt Edge Enhancement Masks**

The Frei and Chen edge enhancement operation uses the two masks shown
in [Figure 9-5](analysis/index.html). This operation, when
compared to the other edge enhancement, operations, is more sensitive
to a configuration of relative pixel values independent of the
brightness magnitude. The following is a listing of how the two masks
are constructed.

```java
float[] freichen_h_data        = { 1.0F,   0.0F,   -1.0F,
                                   1.414F, 0.0F,   -1.414F,
                                   1.0F,   0.0F,   -1.0F
};
float[] freichen_v_data        = {-1.0F,  -1.414F, -1.0F,
                                   0.0F,   0.0F,    0.0F,
                                   1.0F,   1.414F,  1.0F
};

KernelJAI kern_h = new KernelJAI(3,3,freichen_h_data);
KernelJAI kern_v = new KernelJAI(3,3,freichen_v_data);

# 9.6 Statistical Operations

The `StatisticsOpImage` class is an abstract class for image operators
that compute statistics on a given region of an image and with a given
sampling rate. A subclass of `StatisticsOpImage` simply passes pixels
through unchanged from its parent image. However, the desired
statistics are available as a property or set of properties on the
image (see [Chapter 11, \"Image
Properties](../properties)\").

All instances of `StatisticsOpImage` make use of a region of interest,
specified as an `ROI` object. Additionally, they may perform spatial
subsampling of the region of interest according to `xPeriod` and
`yPeriod` parameters that may vary from 1 (sample every pixel of the
`ROI`) upwards. This allows the speed and quality of statistics
gathering to be traded off against one another.

The `accumulateStatistics` method is used to accumulate statistics on
a specified region into the previously-created statistics object.``

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.StatisticsOpImage`

* `StatisticsOpImage()`
* `StatisticsOpImage(RenderedImage source, ROI roi, int xStart, 
           int yStart, int xPeriod, int yPeriod, int maxWidth, 
           int maxHeight)`
