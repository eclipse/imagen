This chapter describes how to get started programming with Eclipse ImageN.

## 3.1 Introduction

An imaging operation within ImageN is summarized in the following four steps:

1. Obtain the source image or images. Images may be obtained in one of three ways (see [Chapter 4, \"Image Acquisition and Display\"](../acquisition)):

   a. Load from an image file such as GIF, TIFF, or JPEG

   b. Fetch the image from another data source, such as a remote server

   c. Generate the image internally

2. Define the imaging graph. This is a two part process:

   a. Define the image operators (see [Section 3.6, \"JAI API Operators\"](#36-operators) )

   b. Define the parent/child relationship between sources and sinks

3. Evaluate the graph using one of three execution models:

   a. Rendered execution model (Immediate mode - see [Section 3.3.1, \"Rendered Graphs\"](#331-rendered-graphs)

   b. Renderable execution model (Deferred mode - see [Section 3.3.2, \"Renderable Graphs\"](#332-renderable-graphs)

   c. Remote execution model (Remote mode - see Section 3.4, "Remote Execution")

4. Process the result. There are four possible destinations:

   a. Save the image in a file

   b. Display the image on the screen

   c. Print the image on a printer or other output device

   d. Send the image to another API, such as Swing


3.2 An Overview of Graphs
----------------------------------------------

In ImageN, any operation is defined as an object. An operator object is
instantiated with zero or more image sources and other parameters that
define the operation. Two or more operators may be strung together so
that the first operator becomes an image source to the next operator.
By linking one operator to another, we create an imaging *graph* or
*chain*.

In its simplest form, the imaging graph is a chain of operator objects
with one or more image sources at one end and an image *sinc* (or
\"user\") at the other end. The graph that is created is commonly
known as a *directed acyclic graph* (DAG), where each object is a
*node* in the graph and object references form the *edges* (see
[Figure 3-1](#figure-3-1)).

<a name="figure-3-1"></a>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Figure 3-1 An Example DAG**

Most APIs simply leave the DAG structure of images and operators
implicit. However, ImageN makes the notion of a *processing graph*
explicit and allows such graphs to be considered as entities in their
own right. Rather than thinking only of performing a series of
operations in sequence, you can consider the graph structure produced
by the operations. The graph form makes it easier to visualize the
operations.

A directed acyclic graph is a graph containing no cycles. This means
that if there is a route from node A to node B then there should be no
way back. Normally, when creating a graph by instantiating new nodes
one at a time, cycles are easily avoided. However, when reconfiguring
a graph, you must be careful not to introduce cycles into the graph.


## 3.3 Processing Graphs

ImageN extends rendering independence, which was introduced in the Java
2D API. With rendering independence, you have the ability to describe
an image as you want it to appear, independent of any specific
instance of it.

In most imaging APIs, the application must know the exact resolution
and size of the source image before it can begin any imaging
operations on the image. The application must also know the resolution
of the output device (computer monitor or color printer) and the color
and tonal quality of the original image. A rendering-independent
description is concerned with none of these. Rendering-independent
sources and operations permit operations to be specified in
resolution-independent coordinates.

Think of rendering independence a bit like how a PostScript file is
handled in a computer. To display a PostScript file on a monitor or to
print the file to a high-resolution phototypesetter, you don\'t need
to know the resolution of the output device. The PostScript file is
essentially rendering independent in that it displays properly no
matter what the resolution of the output device is.

ImageN has a \"renderable\" mode in which it treats all image sources as
rendering independent. You can set up a graph (or chain) of renderable
operations without any concern for the source image resolution or
size; ImageN takes care of the details of the operations.

ImageN introduces two different types of graphs: rendered and renderable.

> **Note:** The following two sections, \"[Rendered
Graphs](#331-rendered-graphs)\" and \"[Renderable
Graphs](#332=renderable-graphs),\" are for advanced ImageN
users. Most programmers will use ImageN\'s Rendered mode and don\'t
really need to know about the Renderable mode.


<a name="rendered"></a>

### 3.3.1 Rendered Graphs

Rendered graphs are the simplest form of rendering in ImageN. Although
Renderable graphs have the advantage of rendering-independence,
eliminating the need to deal directly with pixels, Rendered graphs are
useful when it is necessary to work directly with the pixels.

A Rendered graph processes images in immediate mode. For any node in
the graph, the image source is considered to have been evaluated at
the moment it is instantiated and added to the graph. Or, put another
way, as a new operation is added to the chain, it appears to compute
its results immediately.

A Rendered graph is composed of Rendered object nodes. These nodes are
usually instances of the `RenderedOp` class, but could belong to any
subclass of `PlanarImage`, ImageN\'s version of `RenderedImage`.

Image sources are objects that implement the `RenderedImage`
interface. These sources are specified as parameters in the
construction of new image objects.

Let\'s take a look at an example of a rendered graph in [Listing
3-1](#listing-3-1). This example, which is a
code fragment rather than an entire class definition, creates two
constant images and then adds them together.

***Listing 3-1*  Rendered Chain Example** <a name="listing-3-1"></a>

```java
{% include src/AddExample.java %}
```

The first three lines of the example code specify which classes to
import. The classes prefixed with `org.eclipse.imagen` are the Eclipse ImageN classes. The `java.awt` prefix specifies the core Java API
classes.

```java
import org.eclipse.imagen.*;
import org.eclipse.imagen.widget.*;
import java.awt.Frame;
```

The next line declares the name of the program and that it runs in a
`Frame`, a window with a title and border.

```java
public class AddExample extends Frame {
```

The next line of code creates a `ScrollingImagePanel`, which is the
ultimate destination of our image:

```java
  ScrollingImagePanel imagePanel1;
```

Next, a `ParameterBlock` for each source image is defined. The
parameters specify the image height, width, origin, tile size, and so
on.

```java
   public AddExample(ParameterBlock param1,
                     ParameterBlock param2) {
```

The next two lines define two operations that create the two
\"constant\" images that will be added together to create the
destination image (see [Section 4.7, \"Creating a Constant
Image](../acquisition#47-creating-a-constant-image)\").

```java
   RenderedOp im0 = JAI.create("constant", param1);
   RenderedOp im1 = JAI.create("constant", param2);
```

Next, our example adds the two images together (see [Section 6.5.1,
\"Adding Two Source Images](../image-manipulation)\").

```java
         RenderedOp im2 = JAI.create("add", im0, im1);
```

Finally, we display the destination image in a scrolling window and
add the display widget to our frame.

```java
         imagePanel1 = new ScrollingImagePanel(im2, 100, 100);
         add(imagePanel1);
```

Once pixels start flowing, the graph will look like [Figure
3-2](#figure-3-2). The display widget drives
the process. We mention this because the source images are not loaded
and no pixels are produced until the display widget actually requests
them.

**Figure 3-2 Rendered Chain Example**

### 3.3.2 Renderable Graphs

A *renderable graph* is a graph that is not evaluated at the time it
is specified. The evaluation is deferred until there is a specific
request for a rendering. This is known as *deferred execution*;
evaluation is deferred until there is a specific request for
rendering.

In a renderable graph, if a source image should change before there is
a request for rendering, the changes will be reflected in the output.
This process can be thought of as a \"pull\" model, in which the
requestor pulls the image through the chain, which is the opposite of
the AWT imaging push model.

A renderable graph is made up of nodes implementing the
`RenderableImage` interface, which are usually instances of the
`RenderableOp` class. As the renderable graph is constructed, the
sources of each node are specified to form the graph topology. The
source of a renderable graph is a Renderable image object.

Let\'s take a look at an example of a renderable graph in [Listing
3-2](../programming-environ). This example reads a TIFF
file, inverts its pixel values, then adds a constant value to the
pixels. Once again, this example is a code fragment rather than an
entire class definition.

<a name="listing-3-2"></a>

***Listing 3-2*  Renderable Chain Example**

```java
  // Get rendered source object from a TIFF source.
  // The ParameterBlock `pb0' contains the name
  // of the source (file, URL, etc.). The objects `hints0',
  // `hints1', and `hints2' contain rendering hints and are
  // assumed to be created outside of this code fragment.
  RenderedOp sourceImg = 
            JAI.create("TIFF", pb0);

  // Derive the RenderableImage from the source RenderedImage.
  ParameterBlock pb = new ParameterBlock();
  pb.addSource(sourceImg);
  pb.add(null).add(null).add(null).add(null).add(null);

  // Create the Renderable operation.
  RenderableImage ren = JAI.createRenderable("renderable", pb);

  // Set up the parameter block for the first op.
  ParameterBlock pb1 = new ParameterBlock();
  pb1.addSource(ren);

  // Make first Op in Renderable chain an invert.
  RenderableOp Op1 = JAI.createRenderable("invert", pb1);

  // Set up the parameter block for the second Op.
  // The constant to be added is "2".
  ParameterBlock pb2 = new ParameterBlock();
  pb2.addSource(Op1);        // Op1 as the source
  pb2.add(2.0f);             // 2.0f as the constant

  // Make a second Op a constant add operation.
  RenderableOp Op2 = 
            JAI.createRenderable("addconst", pb2);

  // Set up a rendering context.
  AffineTransform screenResolution = ...;
  RenderContext rc = new RenderContext(screenResolution);

  // Get a rendering.
  RenderedImage rndImg1 = Op2.createRendering(rc);

  // Display the rendering onscreen using screenResolution.
  imagePanel1 = new ScrollingImagePanel(rndImg1, 100, 100);
```

In this example, the image source is a TIFF image. A TIFF `RenderedOp`
is created as a source for the subsequent operations:

```java
  RenderedOp sourceImg = 
            JAI.create("TIFF", pb0);
```

The rendered source image is then converted to a renderable image:

```java
  ParameterBlock pb = new ParameterBlock();
  pb.addSource(sourceImg);
  pb.add(null).add(null).add(null).add(null).add(null);
  RenderableImage ren = JAI.createRenderable("renderable", pb);
```

Next, a `ParameterBlock` is set up for the first operation. The
parameter block contains sources for the operation and parameters or
other objects that the operator may require.

```java
  ParameterBlock pb1 = new ParameterBlock();
  pb1.addSource(sourceImage);
```

An \"invert\" `RenderableOp` is then created with the TIFF image as
the source. The `invert` operation inverts the pixel values of the
source image and creates a `RenderableImage` as the result of applying
the operation to a tuple (source and parameters).

```java
  RenderableOp Op1 = JAI.createRenderable("invert", pb1);
```

The next part of the code example sets up a `ParameterBlock` for the
next operation. The `ParameterBlock` defines the previous operation
(Op1) as the source of the next operation and sets a constant with a
value of 2.0, which will be used in the next \"add constant\"
operation.

```java
  ParameterBlock pb2 = new ParameterBlock();
  pb2.addSource(Op1);        // Op1 as the source
  pb2.add(2.0f);             // 2.0f as the constant
```

The second operation (`Op2`) is an add constant (`addconst`), which
adds the constant value (2.0) to the pixel values of a source image on
a per-band basis. The `pb2` parameter is the `ParameterBlock` set up
in the previous step.

```java
  RenderableOp Op2 = 
            JAI.createRenderable("addconst", pb2);
```

After `Op2` is created, the renderable chain thus far is shown in
[Figure 3-3](#figure-3-3).

<a name="figure-3-3"></a>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](Programming-environ.doc.anc1.gif)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Figure 3-3 Renderable Chain Example***

Next, a `RenderContext` is created using an `AffineTransform` that
will produce a screen-size rendering.

```java
  AffineTransform screenResolution = ...;
  RenderContext rc = new RenderContext(screenResolution);
```

This rendering is created by calling the
`RenderableImage.createRendering` method on `Op2`. The
`createRendering` method does not actually compute any pixels, bit it
does instantiate a `RenderedOp` chain that will produce a rendering at
the appropriate pixel dimensions.

```java
  RenderedImage rndImg1 = Op2.createRendering(rc);
```

The Renderable graph can be thought of as a *template* that, when
rendered, causes the instantiation of a parallel Rendered graph to
accomplish the actual processing. Now let\'s take a look at what
happens back up the rendering chain in our example:

-   When the `Op2.createRendering` method is called, it recursively
    calls the `Op1.createRendering` method with the `RenderContext`
    `rc` as the argument.


-   The `Op1` operation then calls the `sourceImg.getImage` method,
    again with `rc` as the argument. `sourceImg` creates a new
    `RenderedImage` to hold its source pixels at the required
    resolution and inserts it into the chain. It then returns a handle
    to this object to `Op1`.


-   `Op1` then uses the `OperationRegistry` to find a
    `ContextualRenderedImageFactory` (CRIF) that can perform the
    \"invert\" operation. The resulting `RenderedOp` object returned
    by the CRIF is inserted into the chain with the handle returned by
    `sourceImg` as its source.


-   The handle to the \"invert\" `RenderedImage` is returned to `Op2`,
    which repeats the process, creating an \"addconst\" `RenderedOp`,
    inserting it into the chain and returning a handle to `rndImg1`.


-   Finally, `rndImg1` is used in the call to the
    `ScrollingImagePanel` to display the result on the screen.

After the creation of the `ScrollingImagePanel`, the Renderable and
Rendered chains look like [Figure 3-4](#figure-3-4).

<a name="figure-3-4"></a>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](Programming-environ.doc.anc2.gif)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Figure 3-4 Renderable and Rendered Graphs after the getImage Call**

At this point in the chain, no pixels have been processed and no
`OpImages`, which actually calculate the results, have been created.
Only when the `ScrollingImagePanel` needs to put pixels on the screen
are the `OpImages` created and pixels pulled through the Rendered
chain, as done in the final line of code.

```java
 imagePanel1 = new ScrollingImagePanel(rndImg1, 100, 100);
```

### 3.3.3 Reusing Graphs

Many times, it is more desirable to make changes to an existing graph
and reuse it than to create another nearly identical graph. Both
Rendered and Renderable graphs are editable, with certain limitations.

#### 3.3.3.1 Editing Rendered Graphs

Initially, a node in a Rendered graph is mutable; it may be assigned
new sources, which are considered to be evaluated as soon as they are
assigned, and its parameter values may be altered. However, once
rendering takes place at a node, it becomes frozen and its sources and
parameters cannot be changed.

A chain of Rendered nodes may be cloned without freezing any of its
nodes by means of the `RenderedOp.createInstance` method. Using the
`createInstance` method, a Rendered graph may be configured and reused
at will, as well as serialized and transmitted over a network.

The `RenderedOp` class provides several methods for reconfiguring a
Rendered node. The `setParameter` methods can be used to set the
node\'s parameters to a `byte`, `char`, `short`, `int`, `long`,
`float`, `double`, or an `Object`. The `setOperationName` method can
be used to change the operation name. The `setParameterBlock` method
can be used to change the nodes\'s `ParameterBlock`.

#### 3.3.3.2 Editing Renderable Graphs

Since Renderable graphs are not evaluated until there is a specific
request for a rendering, the nodes may be edited at any time. The main
concern with editing Renderable graphs is the introduction of cycles,
which must be avoided.

The `RenderableOp` class provides several methods for reconfiguring a
Renderable node. The `setParameter` methods can be used to set the
node\'s parameters to a `byte`, `char`, `short`, `int`, `long`,
`float`, `double`, or an `Object`. The `setParameterBlock` method can
be used to change the nodes\'s `ParameterBlock`. The `setProperty`
method can be used to change a node\'s local property. The `setSource`
method can be used to set one of the node\'s sources to an `Object`.

## 3.4 Remote Execution

Up to this point, we have been talking about standalone image
processing. ImageN also provides for client-server image processing
through what is called the *Remote Execution* model.

Remote execution is based on Java RMI (remote method invocation). Java
RMI allows Java code on a client to invoke method calls on objects
that reside on another computer without having to move those objects
to the client. The advantages of remote execution become obvious if
you think of several clients wanting to access the same objects on a
server. To learn more about remote method invocation, refer to one of
the books on Java described in [\"Related Documentation\" on page
xv](../Preface).

To do remote method invocation in ImageN, a `RemoteImage` is set up on
the server and a `RenderedImage` chain is set up on the client. For
more information, see [Chapter 12, \"Client-Server
Imaging](../client-server).\"


## 3.5 Basic ImageN API Classes

ImageN consists of several classes grouped into five packages:

-   `org.eclipse.imagen` - contains the \"core\" ImageN interfaces and
    classes


-   `org.eclipse.imagen.iterator` - contains special iterator interfaces
    and classes, which are useful for writing extension operations


-   `org.eclipse.imagen.operator` - contains classes that describe all of
    the image operators


-   `org.eclipse.imagen.widget` - contains interfaces and classes for
    creating simple image canvases and scrolling windows for image
    display

Now, let\'s take a look at the most common classes in the ImageN class
hierarchy.


### 3.5.1 The JAI Class

The `JAI` class cannot be instantiated; it is simply a placeholder for
static methods that provide a simple syntax for creating Renderable
and Rendered graphs. The majority of the methods in this class are
used to create a `RenderedImage`, taking an operation name, a
`ParameterBlock`, and `RenderingHints` as arguments. There is one
method to create a `RenderableImage`, taking an operation name, a
`ParameterBlock`, and `RenderingHints` as arguments.

There are several variations of the `create` method, all of which take
sources and parameters directly and construct a `ParameterBlock`
automatically.


### 3.5.2 The PlanarImage Class

The `PlanarImage` class is the main class for describing
two-dimensional images in ImageN. `PlanarImage` implements the
`RenderedImage` interface from the Java 2D API. `TiledImage` and
`OpImage`, described later, are subclasses of `PlanarImage`.``

The `RenderedImage` interface describes a tiled, read-only image with
a pixel layout described by a `SampleModel` and a `DataBuffer`. Each
tile is a rectangle of identical dimensions, laid out on a regular
grid pattern. All tiles share a common `SampleModel`.

In addition to the capabilities offered by `RenderedImage`,
`PlanarImage` maintains source and sink connections between the nodes
of rendered graphs. Since graph nodes are connected bidirectionally,
the garbage collector requires assistance to detect when a portion of
a graph is no longer referenced from user code and may be discarded.
`PlanarImage` takes care of this by using the *Weak References API* of
Java 2.

Any `RenderedImage`s from outside the API are \"wrapped\" to produce
an instance of `PlanarImage`. This allows the API to make use of the
extra functionality of `PlanarImage` for all images.


### 3.5.3 The CollectionImage Class

`CollectionImage` is the abstract superclass for four classes
representing collections of `PlanarImage`s:

-   `ImageStack` - represents a set of two-dimensional images lying in
    a common three-dimensional space, such as CT scans or seismic
    volumes. The images need not lie parallel to one another.


-   `ImageSequence` - represents a sequence of images with associated
    time stamps and camera positions. This class can be used to
    represent video or time-lapse photography.


-   `ImagePyramid` - represents a series of images of progressively
    lesser resolution, each derived from the last by means of an
    imaging operator.


-   `ImageMIPMap` - represents a stack of images with a fixed
    operational relationship between adjacent slices.


### 3.5.4 The TiledImage Class

The `TiledImage` class represents images containing multiple tiles
arranged into a grid. The tiles form a regular grid, which may occupy
any rectangular region of the plane.

`TiledImage` implements the `WritableRenderedImage` interface from the
Java 2D API, as well as extending `PlanarImage`. A `TiledImage` allows
its tiles to be checked out for writing, after which their pixel data
may be accessed directly. `TiledImage` also has a `createGraphics`
method that allows its contents to be altered using Java 2D API
drawing calls.

A `TiledImage` contains a tile grid that is initially empty. As each
tile is requested, it is initialized with data from a `PlanarImage`
source. Once a tile has been initialized, its contents can be altered.
The source image may also be changed for all or part of the
`TiledImage` using its `set` methods. In particular, an arbitrary
region of interest (ROI) may be filled with data copied from a
`PlanarImage` source.

The `TiledImage` class includes a method that allows you to paint a
`Graphics2D` onto the `TiledImage`. This is useful for adding text,
lines, and other simple graphics objects to an image for annotating
the image. For more on the TiledImage class, see [Section 4.2.2,
\"Tiled Image](../acquisition).\"


### 3.5.5 The OpImage Class

The OpImage class is the parent class for all imaging operations, such
as:

-   `AreaOpImage` - for image operators that require only a fixed
    rectangular source region around a source pixel to compute each
    destination pixel


-   `PointOpImage` - for image operators that require only a single
    source pixel to compute each destination pixel


-   `SourcelessOpImage` - for image operators that have no image
    sources


-   `StatisticsOpImage` - for image operators that compute statistics
    on a given region of an image, and with a given sampling rate


-   `UntiledOpimage` - for single-source operations in which the
    values of all pixels in the source image contribute to the value
    of each pixel in the destination image


-   `WarpOpImage` - for image operators that perform an image warp


-   `ScaleOpImage` - for extension operators that perform image
    scaling requiring rectilinear backwards mapping and padding by the
    resampling filter dimensions``

The `OpImage` is able to determine what source areas are sufficient
for the computation of a given area of the destination by means of a
user-supplied `mapDestRect` method. For most operations, this method
as well as a suitable implementation of `getTile` is supplied by a
standard subclass of `OpImage`, such as `PointOpImage` or
`AreaOpImage`.

An `OpImage` is effectively a `PlanarImage` that is defined
computationally. In `PlanarImage`, the `getTile` method of
`RenderedImage` is left abstract, and `OpImage` subclasses override it
to perform their operation. Since it may be awkward to produce a tile
of output at a time, due to the fact that source tile boundaries may
need to be crossed, the `OpImage` class defines a `getTile` method to
cobble (copy) source data as needed and to call a user-supplied
`computeRect` method. This method then receives contiguous source
`Rasters` that are guaranteed to contain sufficient data to produce
the desired results. By calling `computeRect` on subareas of the
desired tile, `OpImage` is able to minimize the amount of data that
must be cobbled.

A second version of the `computeRect` method that is called with
uncobbled sources is available to extenders. This interface is useful
for operations that are implemented using *iterators* (see [Section
14.4, \"Iterators](../extension)\"), which abstract away
the notion of tile boundaries.


### 3.5.6 The RenderableOp Class

The `RenderableOp` class provides a lightweight representation of an
operation in the Renderable space (see [Section 3.3.2, \"Renderable
Graphs](../programming-environ)\"). `RenderableOp`s are
typically created using the `createRenderable` method of the `JAI`
class, and may be edited at will. `RenderableOp` implements the
`RenderableImage` interface, and so may be queried for its
rendering-independent dimensions.

When a `RenderableOp` is to be rendered, it makes use of the
`OperationRegistry` (described in [Chapter
14](../extension)) to locate an appropriate
`ContextualRenderedImageFactory` object to perform the conversion from
the Renderable space into a `RenderedImage`.


### 3.5.7 The RenderedOp Class

The `RenderedOp` is a lightweight object similar to `RenderableOp`
that stores an operation name, `ParameterBlock`, and `RenderingHints`,
and can be joined into a Rendered graph (see [Section 3.3.1,
\"Rendered Graphs](../programming-environ)\"). There are
two ways of producing a rendering of a `RenderedOp`:

-   Implicit - Any call to a `RenderedImage` method on a `RenderedOp`
    causes a rendering to be created. This rendering will usually
    consist of a chain of `OpImage`s with a similar geometry to the
    `RenderedOp` chain. It may have more or fewer nodes, however,
    since the rendering process may both collapse nodes together by
    recognizing patterns, and expand nodes by the use of the
    `RenderedImageFactory` interface. The `OperationRegistry`
    (described in [Chapter 14](../extension)) is used to
    guide the `RenderedImageFactory` selection process.


-   Explicit - A call to `createInstance` effectively clones the
    `RenderedOp` and its source `RenderedOp`s, resulting in an
    entirely new Rendered chain with the same non-`RenderedOp` sources
    (such as `TiledImage`s) as the original chain. The bottom node of
    the cloned chain is then returned to the caller. This node will
    then usually be implicitly rendered by calling `RenderedImage`
    methods on it.

`RenderedOp`s that have not been rendered may have their sources and
parameters altered. Sources are considered evaluated as soon as they
are connected to a `RenderedOp`.


## 3.6 Operators

Eclipse ImageN specifies a core set of image processing operators. These
operators provide a common ground for applications programmers, since
they can then make assumptions about what operators are guaranteed to
be present on all platforms.

The general categories of image processing operators supported
include:

-   [Point Operators](#361-point-operators)

-   [Area Operators](#362-area-operators)

-   [Geometric Operators](#363-geometric-operators)

-   [Color Quantization Operators](#364-color-quantization-operators)

-   [File Operators](#365-file-operators)

-   [Frequency Operators](#366-frequency-operators)

-   [Statistical Operators](#367-statistical-operators)

-   [Edge Extraction Operators](#368-edge-extraction-operations)

-   [Miscellaneous Operators](#369-miscellaneous-operators)

ImageN also supports abstractions for many common types of image
collections, such as time-sequential data and image pyramids. These
are intended to simplify operations on image collections and allow the
development of operators that work directly on these abstractions.


### 3.6.1 Point Operators

Point operators allow you to modify the way in which the image data
fills the available range of gray levels. This affects the image\'s
appearance when displayed. Point operations transform an input image
into an output image in such a way that each output pixel depends only
on the corresponding input pixel. Point operations do not modify the

### 3.6.2 Area Operators

The area operators perform geometric transformations, which result in
the repositioning of pixels within an image. Using a mathematical
transformation, pixels are located from their *x* and *y* spatial
coordinates in the input image to new coordinates in the output image.

There are two basic types of area operations: linear and nonlinear.
Linear operations include translation, rotation, and scaling.
Non-linear operations, also known as *warping transformations*,
introduce curvatures and bends to the processed image.

[Table 3-2](#table-3-2) lists the area operators.

### 3.6.6 Frequency Operators

Frequency operators are used to decompose an image from its
spatial-domain form into a frequency-domain form of fundamental
frequency components. Operators also are available to perform an
inverse frequency transform, in which the image is converted from the
frequency form back into the spatial form.

JAI supports several frequency transform types. The most common
frequency transform type is the *Fourier* *transform*. Eclipse ImageN uses the
discrete form known as the *discrete Fourier transform*. The *inverse
discrete Fourier transform* can be used to convert the image back to a
spatial image. Eclipse ImageN also supports the *discrete cosine transform* and
its opposite, the *inverse discrete cosine transform*.

[Table 3-6](#table-3-6) lists the frequency operators.

### 3.6.8 Edge Extraction Operators

The edge extraction operators allow image edge enhancement. Edge
enhancement reduces an image to show only its edge details. Edge
enhancement is implemented through spatial filters that detect a
specific *pixel brightness slope* within a group of pixels in an
image. A steep brightness slope indicates the presence of an edge.

: Takes one rendered source image and produces a RenderableImage consisting of a \"pyramid\" of RenderedImages at progressively lower resolutions.   []{#63144} [page 122](../acquisition)\

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3.7 Creating Operations

Most image operation objects are created with some variation on the
following methods:


##### For a renderable graph:

There are two static methods for creating operations in the Renderable mode.

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.JAI`

* `JAI.createRenderable( opName, parameterBlock)`
* `JAI.createRenderableCollection( opName, parameterBlock)`

These call the non static:

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.JAI`

* `createRenderableNS( opName, parameterBlock)`
* `createRenderableCollectionNS( opName, parameterBlock)`

For example:

```java
   RenderableOp im = JAI.createRenderable("operationName",
                               paramBlock);
```

The `JAI.createRenderable` method creates a renderable node operation
that takes two parameters:

-   An operation name (see [Section 3.7.1, \"Operation Name\"](#section-3.7.1-operation-name) )

-   A source and a set of parameters for the operation contained in a
    parameter block (see [Section 3.7.2, \"Parameter Blocks\"](#section-3.7.2-parameter-blocks) )


##### For a rendered graph:

There are a great many more variations on methods for creating
operations in the Rendered mode, as listed in below.

The first static methods take sources and parameters specified in a `ParameterBlock`. 

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.JAI`

* `JAI.create( opName, parameterBlock)`
* `JAI.create( opName, parameterBlock, hints)`
* `JAI.createCollection( opName, parameterBlock)`
* `JAI.createCollection( opName, parameterBlock, hints)`

The remaining static methods are convenience methods that take various
numbers of sources and parameters directly.

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.JAI`

* `JAI.create( opName, param)`
* `JAI.create( opName, param1, param2)`
* `JAI.create( opName, param1, param2, param3)`
* `JAI.create( opName, param1, param2, param3,param4)`
* `JAI.create( opName, renderedImage)`
* `JAI.create( opName, collection)`
* `JAI.create( opName, renderedImage,param)`
* `JAI.create( opName, renderedImage,param1,param2)`
* `JAI.create( opName, renderedImage,param1,param2,param3)`
* `JAI.create( opName, renderedImage,param1,param2,param3,param4)`
* `JAI.create( opName, renderedImage,param1,param2,param3,param4,param5)`
* `JAI.create( opName, renderedImage,param1,param2,param3,param4,param5,param6)`
* `JAI.create( opName, renderedImage1,renderedImage2)`
* `JAI.create( opName, renderedImage1,renderedImage2,param1,param2)`

Two versions of the `create` method are non-static and are identified
as `createNS`. These methods may be used with a specific instance of
the `JAI` class and should only be used when the final result returned
is a single `RenderedImage`. However, the source (or sources) supplied
may be a collection of images or a collection of collections.

These call the non-static methods:

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.JAI`

* `createNS( opName, parameterBlock, hints)`
* `createCollectionNS( opName, parameterBlock, hints)`

The following is an example of one of these methods:

```java
  RenderedOp im = JAI.createNS("operationName", source, param1,
                             param2)
```

The rendering hints associated with this instance of `JAI` are
overlaid with the hints passed to this method. That is, the set of
keys will be the union of the keys from the instance\'s hints and the
hints parameter. If the same key exists in both places, the value from
the hints parameter will be used.

Many of the operations have default values for some of the
parameters. If you wish to use any of the default values in an
operation, you do not have to specify that particular parameter in the
`ParameterBlock`. The default value is automatically used in the
operation. Parameters that do not have default values are required;
failure to supply a required parameter results in a
`NullPointerException`.


### 3.7.1 Operation Name

The operation name describes the operator to be created. The operation
name is a string, such as `"add"` for the operation to add two images.
See [Section 3.6, \"JAI API
Operators](#36-operators),\" for a list of the
operator names.

The operation name is always enclosed in quotation marks. For example:

```java
         "Mean"
         "BoxFilter"
         "UnsharpMask"
```

The operation name parsing is case-insensitive. All of the following
variations are legal:

```java
         "OrConst"
         "orConst"
         "ORconst"
         "ORCONST"
         "orconst"
```

### 3.7.2 Parameter Blocks

The parameter block contains the source of the operation and a set
parameters used by the operation. The contents of the parameter block
depend on the operation being created and may be as simple as the name
of the source image or may contain all of the operator parameters
(such as the *x* and *y* displacement and interpolation type for the
`translate` operation).

Parameter blocks encapsulate all the information about sources and
parameters (Objects) required by the operation. The parameters
specified by a parameter block are objects.

These controlling parameters and sources can be edited through the
`setParameterBlock` method to affect specific operations or even the
structure of the rendering chain itself. The modifications affect
future `RenderedImages` derived from points in the chain below where
the change took place.

There are two separate classes for specifying parameter blocks:

-   `java.awt.image.renderable.ParameterBlock` - the main class for
    specifying and changing parameter blocks.

-   `org.eclipse.imagen.ParameterBlockJAI` - extends `ParameterBlock` by
    allowing the use of default parameter values and the use of
    parameter names.

The parameter block must contain the same number of sources and
parameters as required by the operation (unless ParameterBlockJAI is
used and the operation supplies default values). Note that, if the
operation calls for one or more source images, they must be specified
in the parameter block. For example, the `Add` operation requires two
source images and no parameters. The `addConst` operator requires one
source and a parameter specifying the constant value.

If the sources and parameters do not match the operation requirements,
an exception is thrown. However, when the `ParameterBlockJAI` class is
used, if the required parameter values are not specified, default
parameter values are automatically inserted when available. For some
operations, default parameter values are not available and must be
supplied.


#### 3.7.2.1 Adding Sources to a Parameter Block

Sources are added to a parameter block with the `addSource()` method.
The following example creates a new `ParameterBlock` named `pb` and
then the `addSource()` method is used to add the source image (`im0`)
to the `ParameterBlock`.

```java
  ParameterBlock pb = new ParameterBlock();
  pb.addSource(im0);
```

To add two sources to a parameter block, use two `addSource()`
methods.

```java
  ParameterBlock pb = new ParameterBlock();
  pb.addSource(im0);
  pb.addSource(im1);
```

#### 3.7.2.2 Adding or Setting Parameters

As described before, there are two separate classes for specifying
parameter blocks: `ParameterBlock` and `ParameterBlockJAI`. Both
classes work very much alike, except for two differences:
`ParameterBlockJAI` automatically provides default parameter values
and allows setting parameters by name; `ParameterBlock` does not.``


##### ParameterBlock

The operation parameters are added to a `ParameterBlock` with the
`ParameterBlock.add()` method. The following example adds two values
(`150` and `200`) to the `ParameterBlock` named `pb`, which was
created in the previous example.

```java
  pb.add(150);
  pb.add(200);
```

The `add()` method can be used with all of the supported data types:
byte, short, integer, long, float, and double. When using the
`ParameterBlock` object, all parameters that an operation requires
must be added, else the operation will fail.``

**API:** `java.awt.image.renderable.ParameterBlock`

* `ParameterBlock addSource(Object source)`

* `ParameterBlock add(byte b)`

* `ParameterBlock add(short s)`

* `ParameterBlock add(int i)`

* `ParameterBlock add(long l)`

* `ParameterBlock add(float f)`

* `ParameterBlock add(double d)`

##### ParameterBlockJAI

Since the `ParameterBlockJAI` object already contains default values
for the parameters at the time of construction, the parameters must be
changed (or set) with the `ParameterBlockJAI.set(value, index)`
methods rather than the `add()` method. The `add()` methods should not
be used since the parameter list is already long enough to hold all of
the parameters required by the `OperationDescriptor`.

[Listing 3-3](../programming-environ) shows the creation
of a `ParameterBlockJAI` intended to be passed to a rotate operation.
The rotate operation takes four parameters: `xOrigin`, `yOrigin`,
`angle`, and `interpolation`. The default values for `xOrigin` and
`yOrigin` are 0.0F (for both). In this example, these two values are
not set, as the default values are sufficient for the operation. The
other two parameters (`angle` and `interpolation`) have default values
of `null` and must therefore be set. The source image must also be
specified.

***Listing 3-3*  Example ParameterBlockJAI**

```java
  // Specify the interpolation method to be used
  interp = Interpolation.create(Interpolation.INTERP_NEAREST);

  // Create the ParameterBlockJAI and add the interpolation to it
  ParameterBlockJAI pb = new ParameterBlockJAI();
  pb.addSource(im);                 // The source image
  pb.set(1.2F, "angle");            // The rotation angle in radians
  pb.set(interp, "interpolation");  // The interpolation method
```

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.ParameterBlockJAI`


* `ParameterBlock set(byte b, String paramName)`

* `ParameterBlock set(char c, String paramName)`

* `ParameterBlock set(int i, String paramName)`

* `ParameterBlock set(short s, String paramName)`

* `ParameterBlock set(long l, String paramName)`

* `ParameterBlock set(float f, String paramName)`

* `ParameterBlock set(double d, String paramName)`

* `ParameterBlock set(java.lang.Object obj, String paramName)`

### 3.7.3 Rendering Hints

The rendering hints contain a set of hints that describe how objects
are to be rendered. The rendering hints are always optional in any
operation.

Rendering hints specify different rendering algorithms for such things
as antialiasing, alpha interpolation, and dithering. Many of the hints
allow a choice between rendering quality or speed. Other hints turn
off or on certain rendering options, such as antialiasing and
fractional metrics.

There are two separate classes for specifying rendering hints:

-   `java.awt.RenderingHints` - contains rendering hints that can be
    used by the `Graphics2D` class, and classes that implement
    `BufferedImageOp` and `Raster`.

-   `org.eclipse.imagen.JAI` - provides methods to define the
    RenderingHints keys specific to JAI.

#### 3.7.3.1 Java AWT Rendering Hints

[Table 3-12](#table-3-12) lists the rendering
hints inherited from `java.awt.RenderingHints`.


<a name="table-3-12"></a> **Table 3-12 Java AWT Rendering Hints**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Alpha_Interpolation` values:

* `Alpha_Interpolation_Default` rendering is done with the platform default alpha
  interpolation.

* `Alpha\_Interpolation_Quality` appropriate rendering algorithms are chosen with a
  preference for output quality.

* `Alpha_Interpolation_Speed` appropriate rendering algorithms are chosen with a
  preference for output speed.

`Antialiasing` values:

* `Antialias_Default` rendering is done with the platform default antialiasing
mode.

* `Antialias_Off` rendering is done without antialiasing.

* `Antialias_On` rendering is done with antialiasing

`Color_Rendering` values:

* `Color_Render_Default` rendering is done with the platform default color
rendering.

* `Color_Render_Quality` appropriate rendering algorithms are chosen with a preference for
output quality.

* `Color_Render_Speed` appropriate rendering algorithms are chosen with a preference for
output speed.

`Dithering` values:

* `Dither_Default` use the platform default for dithering.

* `Dither_Disable` do not do dither when rendering.

* `Dither_Enable` dither with rendering when needed.

`FractionalMetrics` values:

* `FractionalMetrics_Default` use the platform default for fractional metrics.

* `FractionalMetrics_Off` disable fractional metrics.

* `FractionalMetrics_On` enable fractional metrics.

`Interpolation` values:

* `Interpolation_Bicubic` perform bicubic interpolation.

* `Interpolation_Bilinear` perform bilinear interpolation.

* `Interpolation_Nearest_Neighbor` perform nearest-neighbor interpolation.

`Rendering` values:

* `Render_Default` the platform default rendering algorithms will be chosen.

* `Render_Quality` appropriate rendering algorithms are chosen with a preference for
output quality.

* `Render_Speed` appropriate rendering algorithms are chosen with a preference for
output speed.

`Text_Antialiasing` values:

* `Text_Antialias_Default` text rendering is done using the platform default text antialiasing
mode.

* `Text_Antialias_Off` text rendering is done without antialiasing.

* `Text_Antialias_On`
 text rendering is done with antialiasing.

----------------------------

To set the rendering hints, create a `RenderingHints` object and pass
it to the `JAI.create` method you want to affect. Setting a rendering
hint does not guarantee that a particular rendering algorithm, will be
used; not all platforms support modification of the rendering code.

In the following example, the rendering preference is set to quality.

```java
qualityHints = new
               RenderingHints(RenderingHints.KEY_RENDERING,
               RenderingHints.VALUE_RENDER_QUALITY);
```

Now that a `RenderingHints` object, `qualityHints`, has been created,
the hints can be used in an operation using a `JAI.create` method.


#### 3.7.3.2 JAI Rendering Hints

Each instance of a `JAI` object contains a set of rendering hints that
will be used for all image or collection creations. These hints are
merged with any hints supplied to the `JAI.create` method; directly
supplied hints take precedence over the common hints. When a new `JAI`
instance is constructed, its hints are initialized to a copy of the
hints associated with the default instance. The hints associated with
any instance, including the default instance, may be manipulated using
the `getRenderingHint`, `setRenderingHints`, and `clearRenderingHints`
methods. As a convenience, `getRenderingHint`, `setRenderingHint`, and
`removeRenderingHint` methods are provided that allow individual hints
to be manipulated. [Table 3-13](../programming-environ)
lists the JAI rendering hints.

[Listing 3-4](#listing-3-4) shows an example of
image layout rendering hints being specified for a Scale operation.
The image layout rendering hint specifies that the origin of the
destination opimage is set to 200 x 200.

<a name="listing-3-4">**Listing 3-4 Example of Rendering Hints**</a>

```java
  // Create the parameter block for the scale operation.
  ParameterBlock pb = new ParameterBlock();
      pb.addSource(im0);      // The source image
      pb.add(4.0F);           // The x scale factor
      pb.add(4.0F);           // The y scale factor
      pb.add(interp);         // The interpolation method

  // Specify the rendering hints.
      layout = new ImageLayout();
      layout.setMinX(200);
      layout.setMinY(200);
      RenderingHints rh =
              new RenderingHints(JAI.KEY_IMAGE_LAYOUT, layout);

  // Create the scale operation.
  PlanarImage im2 = (PlanarImage)JAI.create("scale", pb, layout)
```
