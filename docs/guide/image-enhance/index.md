7.1 Introduction
-------------------------------------

The ImageN API image enhancement operations include:

-   Adding borders

-   Cropping an image

-   Amplitude rescaling

-   Histogram equalization

-   Lookup table modification

-   Convolution filtering

-   Median filtering

-   Frequency domain processing

-   Pixel point processing

-   Thresholding (binary contrast enhancement)

7.2 Adding Borders to Images
-------------------------------------------------

ImageN provides two different ways of adding a border to an image. These
two ways are described in the following paragraphs.


### 7.2.1 The Border Operation

The `Border` operation allows you to add a simple filled border around
a source image. The border extends the source image\'s boundaries by a
specified number of pixels.The amount of extension may be specified
separately for the top, bottom, and left and right sides. The
following types of border fill may be specified:

-   Zero fill - the border area is extended with zeros
    (`BORDER_ZERO_FILL`).

-   Constant fill - the border area is extended with a specified
    constant value (`BORDER_CONST_FILL`). An array of constants must
    be supplied. The array must have at least one element, in which
    case this same constant is applied to all destination image bands.
    Or, it may have a different constant entry for each corresponding
    band. For all other border types, this `constants` parameter may
    be `null`.

-   Extend - the border area is created by copying the edge and corner
    pixels (`BORDER_COPY`).

-   Reflection - the border area is created by reflection of the
    image\'s outer edge (`BORDER_REFLECT`).

-   Wrap - the border area is extended by \"wrapping\" the image plane
    toroidally, that is, joining opposite edges of the image
    (`BORDER_WRAP`).

***Figure 7-1* Image Borders**

The image layout (tile width, height, and offsets; `SampleModel` and
`ColorModel`) is copied from the source. The `Border` operation takes
one rendered source image and six parameters:

| Parameters | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| leftPad | Integer | The image\'s left padding. |
| rightPad | Integer | The image\'s right padding. |
| topPad | Integer | The image\'s top padding. |
| bottomPad | Integer | The image\'s bottom padding. |
| type | Integer | The border type. One of BORDER\_ZERO, BORDER\_CONST\_FILL, BORDER\_COPY, BORDER\_REFLECT, or BORDER\_WRAP. The default is BORDER\_ZERO. |
| constant | double | The constants used by the BORDER\_CONST\_FILL. |


### 7.2.2 Extending the Edge of an Image

Some area operations, such as convolve, scale, and rotate, benefit
from the addition of an extended border around the source image. The
extended border comes into play when the convolution kernel overlaps
the source image as the key value is scanned over it.

A `BorderExtender` may be applied to an operation using a suitable
hint. The hints are defined in [Table
7-1](Image-enhance.doc.html#68640).


***Table 7-1*  BorderExtender Hints** <a name="table-7-1"></a>

| Name | Description |
| BorderExtenderZero | Extends an image\'s border by filling all pixels outside the image bounds with zeros. See [Section 7.2.2.1, \"BorderExtenderZero](Image-enhance.doc.html#72409).\"\ |
| BorderExtenderConstant | Extends an image\'s border by filling all pixels outside the image bounds with constant values. See [Section 7.2.2.2, \"BorderExtenderConstant](Image-enhance.doc.html#72000).\"\ |
| BorderExtenderCopy | Extends an image\'s border by filling all pixels outside the image bounds with copies of the edge pixels. Useful as a way of padding source images prior to area or geometric operations, such as convolution, scaling, or rotation. See [Section 7.2.2.3, \"BorderExtenderCopy](Image-enhance.doc.html#72770).\"\ |
| BorderExtenderWrap | Extends an image\'s border by filling all pixels outside the image bounds with copies of the whole image. This form of extension is appropriate for data that is inherently periodic, such as the Fourier transform of an image, or a wallpaper pattern. See [Section 7.2.2.4, \"BorderExtenderWrap](Image-enhance.doc.html#73128).\"\ |
| BorderExtenderReflect | Extends an image\'s border by filling all pixels outside the image bounds with copies of the whole image. This form of extension avoids discontinuities around the edges of the image. See [Section 7.2.2.5, \"BorderExtenderReflect](Image-enhance.doc.html#73456).\"\ |

The `BorderExtender` class is the superclass for four classes that
extend a `WritableRaster` with additional pixel data taken from a
`PlanarImage`. Instances of `BorderExtender` are used by the
`PlanarImage.getExtendedData` and `PlanarImage.copyExtendedData`
methods.

The `PlanarImage.getExtendedData` method returns a copy of an
arbitrary rectangular region of the image in a `Raster`. The portion
of the rectangle of interest outside the bounds of the image will be
computed by calling the given `BorderExtender`. If the region falls
entirely within the image, the extender will not be used. Thus it is
possible to use a `null` value for the `extender` parameter when it is
known that no actual extension will be required. The returned `Raster`
should be considered non-writable. The `copyExtendedData` method
should be used if the returned `Raster` is to be modified.

The `PlanarImage.copyExtendedData` method copies an arbitrary
rectangular region of the `RenderedImage` into a caller-supplied
`WritableRaster`. The portion of the supplied `WritableRaster` that
lies outside the bounds of the image is computed by calling the given
`BorderExtender`. The supplied `WritableRaster` must have a
`SampleModel` that is compatible with that of the image.

Each instance of `BorderExtender` has an `extend` method that takes a
`WritableRaster` and a `PlanarImage`. The portion of the raster that
intersects the bounds of the image will already contain a copy of the
image data. The remaining area is to be filled in according to the
policy of the `BorderImage` subclass. The subclasses are described in
[Table 7-1](#table-7-1).

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.Planarimage`

* `Raster getExtendedData(Rectangle region, BorderExtender  extender)`
* `void copyExtendedData(WritableRaster dest, BorderExtender  extender)`

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.BorderExtender`

* `static BorderExtender createInstance(int extenderType)`
* `abstract void extend(WritableRaster raster, PlanarImage im)`

#### 7.2.2.1 BorderExtenderZero

The `BorderExtenderZero` class is a subclass of `BorderExtender` that
implements border extension by filling all pixels outside of the image
bounds with zeros. For example, [Figure
7-2](Image-enhance.doc.html#73911) shows the result of using
`BorderExtenderZero` to extend an image by adding two extra rows to
the top and bottom and two extra columns on the left and right sides.

***Figure 7-2* BorderExtenderZero Example**

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.BorderExtenderZero`

* `final void extend(WritableRaster raster, PlanarImage im)`

#### 7.2.2.2 BorderExtenderConstant

The `BorderExtenderConstant` class is a subclass of `BorderExtender`
that implements border extension by filling all pixels outside of the
image bounds with constant values. For example, [Figure
7-3](Image-enhance.doc.html#74089) shows the result of using
`BorderExtenderConstant` to extend an image by adding two extra rows
to the top and bottom and two extra columns on the left and right
sides.

In the figure, X is the constant fill value. The set of constants is
clamped to the range and precision of the data type of the `Raster`
being filled. The number of constants used is given by the number of
bands of the `Raster`. If the `Raster` has *b* bands, and there are
*c* constants, constants 0 through *b* - 1 are used when *b*
≤ *c*. If *b* \*c*, zeros are used to
fill out the constants array.

* `BorderExtenderConstant(double[] constants)`
* `final void extend(WritableRaster raster, PlanarImage im)`

#### 7.2.2.3 BorderExtenderCopy

The `BorderExtenderCopy` class is a subclass of `BorderExtender` that
implements border extension by filling all pixels outside of the image
bounds with copies of the edge pixels. For example, [Figure
7-4](Image-enhance.doc.html#74281) shows the result of using
`BorderExtenderCopy` to extend an image by adding two extra rows to
the top and bottom and two extra columns on the left and right sides.

Although this type of extension is not particularly visually
appealing, it is useful as a way of padding source images prior to
area or geometric operations, such as convolution, scaling, or
rotation.

* `final void extend(WritableRaster raster, PlanarImage im)`

#### 7.2.2.4 BorderExtenderWrap

The `BorderExtenderWrap` class is a subclass of `BorderExtender` that
implements border extension by filling all pixels outside of the image
bounds with copies of the whole image. For example, [Figure
7-5](Image-enhance.doc.html#74469) shows the result of using
`BorderExtenderWrap` to extend an image by adding two extra rows to
the top and bottom and two extra columns on the left and right sides.

This form of extension is appropriate for data that is inherently
periodic, such as the Fourier transform of an image or a wallpaper
pattern.

* `final void extend(WritableRaster raster, PlanarImage im)`

#### 7.2.2.5 BorderExtenderReflect

The `BorderExtenderReflect` class is a subclass of `BorderExtender`
that implements border extension by filling all pixels outside the
image bounds with reflected copies of the whole image. For example,
[Figure 7-6](Image-enhance.doc.html#74693) shows the result of using
`BorderExtenderReflect` to extend an image by adding two extra rows to
the top and bottom and one extra column on the left and right sides.

This form of extension avoids discontinuities around the edges of the
image.

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.BorderExtenderReflect`

* `final void extend(WritableRaster raster, PlanarImage im)`

7.3 Cropping an Image
------------------------------------------

The `Crop` operation crops a rendered or renderable image to a
specified rectangular area. The *x*, *y*, width, and height values are
clipped to the source image\'s bounding box. These values are rounded
to type `int` for rendered images.

The `Crop` operation takes one rendered or renderable source image and
four parameters. None of the parameters have default values; all must
be supplied.

| Parameters | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| x          | Float | The *x* origin for each band. |
| y          | Float | The *y* origin for each band. |
| width      | Float | The width for each band. |
| height     | Float | The height for each band. |

<a name="figure-7-7"></a>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Figure 7-7* Crop Operation**


7.4 Amplitude Rescaling
--------------------------------------------

Amplitude rescaling provides a linear amplitude transformation of
input pixel values to output pixel values. Amplitude rescaling can be
used to enhance images that have insufficient contrast between the
lightest and darkest values, such as caused by underexposure or
overexposure of the original image.

The full dynamic range of one band of an eight-bit image is 0 to 255.
An underexposed image may only contain pixel values from 10 to 180,
resulting in an image that does not fully use the dynamic range of the
display. Such an image can be greatly improved by linearly stretching
the contrast range; mapping the lowest values to 0 and the highest
values to 255.

The `rescale` operation takes a rendered or renderable source image
and maps the pixel values of the image from one range to another range
by multiplying each pixel value by one of a set of constants and then
adding another constant to the result of the multiplication. If the
number of constants supplied is less than the number of bands of the
destination, the constant from entry 0 is applied to all the bands.
Otherwise, a constant from a different entry is applied to each band.
There must be at least one entry in each of the constants and offsets
arrays.

The pixel values of the destination image are defined by the following
pseudocode:

```
constant = (constants.length < dstNumBands) ?
            constants[0] : constants[b];
offset = (offsets.length < dstNumBands) ?
          offsets[0] : offsets[b];

dst[x][y][b] = src[x][y][b]*constant + offset;
```

The pixel arithmetic is performed using the data type of the
destination image. By default, the destination will have the same data
type as the source image unless an `ImageLayout` containing a
`SampleModel` with a different data type is supplied as a rendering
hint.

The values of the lowest and highest pixel amplitudes must be known.
This information can be acquired through the `Extrema` operation (see
[Section 9.3, \"Finding the Extrema of an
Image](Analysis.doc.html#54907)\").

The following equations show the relationships between the extrema and
the scale and offset factors.



:   where *max*(*b*) and *min*(*b*) are the largest and smallest pixel
    values in the band, respectively.

The `rescale` operation takes one rendered or renderable source image
and two parameters:

| Parameters | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| constants  | double | The per-band constants to multiply by. |
| offsets    | double | The per-band offsets to be added. |


7.5 Histogram Equalization
-----------------------------------------------

An image histogram is an analytic tool used to measure the amplitude
distribution of pixels within an image. For example, a histogram can
be used to provide a count of the number of pixels at amplitude 0, the
number at amplitude 1, and so on. By analyzing the distribution of
pixel amplitudes, you can gain some information about the visual
appearance of an image. A high-contrast image contains a wide
distribution of pixel counts covering the entire amplitude range. A
low contrast image has most of the pixel amplitudes congregated in a
relatively narrow range.

See [Section 9.4, \"Histogram Generation](Analysis.doc.html#54836),\"
for information on how to generate a histogram for an image. The next
two sections describe ImageN operations that use an image histogram to
enhance an image\'s appearance.


### 7.5.1 Piecewise Linear Mapping

The `Piecewise` operation performs a piecewise linear mapping of an
image\'s pixel values. The piecewise linear mapping is described by a
set of breakpoints that are provided as an array of the form:

```
float breakPoints[N][2][numBreakPoints]
```

Where the value of *N* may be either unity or the number of bands in the source image.

If *N* is unity, the same set of breakpoints will be applied to all
bands in the image. The abscissas of the supplied breakpoints must be
monotonically increasing.

The pixel values of the destination image are defined by the following
pseudocode:
```
if(src[x][y][b] < breakPoints[b][0][0])
    dst[x][y][b] = breakPoints[b][1][0]);
} else if(src[x][y][b] breakPoints[b][0][numBreakPoints-1]) {
    dst[x][y][b] = breakPoints[b][1][numBreakPoints-1]);
} else {
    int i = 0;
    while(breakPoints[b][0][i+1] < src[x][y][b]) {
        i++;
    }
    dst[x][y][b] = breakPoints[b][1][i] +
                    (src[x][y][b] - breakPoints[b][0][i])*
                    (breakPoints[b][1][i+1] - breakPoints[b][1][i])/
                    (breakPoints[b][0][i+1] - breakPoints[b][0][i]);
```

The `Piecewise` operation takes one rendered or renderable source
image and one parameter:

| Parameters | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| breakPoints | Float | The breakpoint array. |

[Listing 7-1](#listing-7-1) shows a code sample of a
`Piecewise` operation, showing only the construction of the
piecewise-mapped image and the operation. The generation of the source
image, fmt, is not shown.

***Listing 7-1*  Example Piecewise Operation** <a name="listing-7-1"></a>

```java
// Create a piecewise-mapped image emphasizing low values.
float[][][] bp = new float[numBands][2][];
for(int b = 0; b < numBands; b++) {
    bp[b][0] = new float[] {0.0F, 32.0F, 64.0F, 255.0F};
    bp[b][1] = new float[] {0.0F, 64.0F, 112.0F, 255.0F};
}

// Create the Piecewise operation.
RenderedOp pw = JAI.create("piecewise", fmt, bp);
```

### 7.5.2 Histogram Matching

It is sometimes desirable to transform an image so that its histogram
matches that of a specified functional form. The `MatchCDF` operation
performs a piecewise linear mapping of the pixel values of an image
such that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the
destination image matches as closely as possible a specified
cumulative distribution function.

The CDF of an image is its area-normalized threshold area function.
The desired CDF for the `MatchCDF` operation is described by an array
of the form:

```
float CDF[numBands][numBins[b]]
```

Where `numBins` denotes the number of bins in the histogram of the source image for band *b*.

Each element in the array `CDF[b]` must be non-negative, the array
must represent a non-decreasing sequence, and the last element of the
array must be 1.0F. The source image must have a `Histogram` object
available via its `getProperty` method.

The `MatchCDF` operation takes one rendered or renderable source image
and one parameter:

| Parameters | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| CDF        | Float | The desired cumulative distribution function. |

The operation requires that the image histogram be available.

[Listing 7-2](#listing-7-2) shows a code sample of a
`MatchCDF` operation, showing only the histogram operation,
construction of two different CDFs, and the operations that use them.

***Listing 7-2* Example MatchCDF Operation**  <a name="listing-7-2"></a>

```java
// Retrieves a histogram for the image.
private static Histogram getHistogram(RenderedOp img,
                                     int binCount) {

    // Get the band count.
    int numBands = img.getSampleModel().getNumBands();

    // Allocate histogram memory.
    int[] numBins = new int[numBands];
    double[] lowValue = new double[numBands];
    double[] highValue = new double[numBands];
    for(int i = 0; i < numBands; i++) {
        numBins[i] = binCount;
        lowValue[i] = 0.0;
        highValue[i] = 255.0;
    }

    // Create the Histogram object.
    Histogram hist = new Histogram(numBins, lowValue, highValue);

    // Set the ROI to the entire image.
    ROIShape roi = new ROIShape(img.getBounds());

    // Create the histogram op.
    RenderedOp histImage =
        JAI.create("histogram", img,
                    hist, roi, new Integer(1), new Integer(1));

    // Retrieve the histogram.
    hist = (Histogram)histImage.getProperty("histogram");

    return hist;
}

// Create an equalization CDF.
float[][] CDFeq = new float[numBands][];
for(int b = 0; b < numBands; b++) {
    CDFeq[b] = new float[binCount];
    for(int i = 0; i < binCount; i++) {
        CDFeq[b][i] = (float)(i+1)/(float)binCount;
    }
}

// Create a normalization CDF.
double[] mean = new double[] {128.0, 128.0, 128.0};
double[] stDev = new double[] {64.0, 64.0, 64.0};
float[][] CDFnorm = new float[numBands][];
for(int b = 0; b < numBands; b++) {
    CDFnorm[b] = new float[binCount];
    double mu = mean[b];
    double twoSigmaSquared = 2.0*stDev[b]*stDev[b];
    CDFnorm[b][0] =
        (float)Math.exp(-mu*mu/twoSigmaSquared);
    for(int i = 1; i < binCount; i++) {
        double deviation = i - mu;
        CDFnorm[b][i] = CDFnorm[b][i-1] +
           (float)Math.exp(-deviation*deviation/twoSigmaSquared);
    }
}
for(int b = 0; b < numBands; b++) {
    double CDFnormLast = CDFnorm[b][binCount-1];
   for(int i = 0; i < binCount; i++) {
       CDFnorm[b][i] /= CDFnormLast;
   }
}

// Create a histogram-equalized image.
RenderedOp eq = JAI.create("matchcdf", fmt, CDFeq);

// Create a histogram-normalized image.
RenderedOp nm = JAI.create("matchcdf", fmt, CDFnorm);
```

7.6 Lookup Table Modification
--------------------------------------------------

The lookup table modification provides a non-linear amplitude
transformation. Non-linear amplitude transformation is useful if you
have a non-linear amplitude response difference between the sensor
that captures the image data and the display.

The lookup table modification mechanism allows you to arbitrarily
convert between the source image byte, short, or integer pixel value
and one or more output values. The output value can be a byte, short,
integer, float, or double image pixel.

The input pixel value acts as an address to the lookup table inputs,
as shown in [Figure 7-8](Image-enhance.doc.html#51273). Each location
in the lookup table stores the desired output value for that
particular address.


<a name="figure-7-8"></a>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](Image-enhance.doc.anc.gif)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Figure 7-8* Lookup Table**

The lookup table is first loaded with the necessary data. [Table
7-2](Image-enhance.doc.html#51279) shows a partial listing of an
example lookup table. In this example, the input values range from 0
to 255. The output values provide a scaled square root transformation
between the input and output, according to the following equation:

![](Image-enhance.doc.anc1.gif)

***Table 7-2*  Example Lookup Table**  <a name="table-7-2"></a>

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 0     | 0   |
| 1     | 16  |
| 2     | 23  |
| 3     | 28  |
| .     | .   |
| 253   | 254 |
| 254   | 255 |
| 255   | 255 |

This example provides a non-linear amplitude transformation between
input and output pixel values, in which the smaller input amplitude
values are amplified and the larger input values are attenuated. Other
types of lookup values can be used to solve nearly any non-linear
amplitude scaling problem.


### 7.6.1 Creating the Lookup Table

The `LookupTableJAI` object represents a single- or multi-banded table
or a color cube of any supported data types. A single- or multi-banded
source image of integer data types is passed through the table and
transformed into a single- or multi-banded destination image of both
integral and float or double data types.

The `LookupTableJAI` object is used for the `ErrorDiffusion`
operation, where it describes a color map, and the `Lookup` operation,
where it describes the lookup table. For the `Lookup` operation, the
table data may cover only a subrange of the legal range of the input
data type. The subrange is selected by means of an offset parameter
that is to be subtracted from the input value before indexing into the
table array.

The procedures for constructing a lookup table vary slightly,
depending on whether the input image is single-banded or multi-banded.
For a single-band input image, you construct a single lookup table.
For a multi-band image, you construct a single lookup table with
entries for each band.


#### 7.6.1.1 Creating a Single-band Lookup Table

The single-banded lookup table contains data for a single channel or
image component. To create a lookup table for a single-band input
image, use one of the single-band constructors. The constructors take
up to three parameters:

-   A pointer to the data to be stored in the table. The data may be
    of type `Byte`, `Short`, `UShort`, `Int`, `Float`, or `Double`.

-   The offset. The offset selects the lookup table subrange. The
    offset value is subtracted from the input value before indexing
    into the table array.

-   A boolean flag that indicates whether Short data is of type Short
    or UShort.

[Listing 7-3](#listing-7-3) shows an example of the
construction of a single-band byte lookup table.

***Listing 7-3* Example Single-band Lookup Table**  <a name="listing-7-3"></a>

```java
byte[] tableData = new byte[0x10000];
for (int i = 0; i < 0x10000; i++) {
tableData[i] = (byte)(i >8);
}

// Create a LookupTableJAI object to be used with the
// "lookup" operator.
LookupTableJAI table = new LookupTableJAI(tableData);
```

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.LookupTableJAI`

* `LookupTableJAI(byte[] data)`
* `LookupTableJAI(byte[] data, int offset)`
* `LookupTableJAI(short[] data, boolean isUShort)`
* `LookupTableJAI(short[] data, int offset, boolean isUShort)`
* `LookupTableJAI(int[] data)`
* `LookupTableJAI(int[] data, int offset)`
* `LookupTableJAI(float[] data)`
* `LookupTableJAI(float[] data, int offset)`
* `LookupTableJAI(double[] data)`
* `LookupTableJAI(double[] data, int offset)`

#### 7.6.1.2 Creating a Multi-band Lookup Table

The multi-band lookup table contains data for more than one channels
or image components, such as separate arrays for R, G, and B. To
create a lookup table for a multi-band input image, use one of the
multi-band constructors. Like the single-band constructors, the
multi-band constructors take up to three parameters:

-   A pointer to the data to be stored in the table. The data may be
    of type Byte, Short, UShort, Int, Float, or Double.


-   The offset. The offset selects the lookup table subrange. The
    offset value is subtracted from the input value before indexing
    into the table array. The constructors allow you to specify one
    offset for all of the bands or separate offsets for each band.


-   A boolean flag that indicates whether Short data is of type Short
    or UShort.

[Listing 7-4](#listing-7-4) shows an example of the
construction of a multi-banded byte lookup table.

***Listing 7-4*  Example Multi-band Lookup Table**  <a name="listing-7-4"></a>

#### 7.6.1.3 Creating a Color-cube Lookup Table

Dithering operations that use a color cube are considerably faster
than those that use a generic lookup table. However, the color cube
provides less control over the exact contents of the lookup table.

The `ColorCube` class is a subclass of `LookupTableJAI` and represents
a color cube lookup table. You create a colorcube using one of the
`ColorCube.createColorCube` methods. Rather than specifying the data
to be loaded into the lookup table, you provide an array of
`dimensions`. The `dimensions` parameter specifies the size (or number
of levels) of each band of the image.

Although a color cube implies three dimensions, that is not always the
case. The color cube has the same number of `dimensions` as the image
has bands. For example, a monochrome image requires only one
`dimension` parameter.

The values in the `dimensions` parameter are signed. A positive value
indicates that the corresponding color ramp increases. A negative
value indicates that the ramp decreases.

ImageN provides two predefined color cubes, which can be used for the
ordered dither operation (see [Section 6.6.1, \"Ordered
Dither](Image-manipulation.doc.html#56241)\"):

| ColorCube | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| BYTE\_496 | A ColorCube with dimensions 4:9:6, useful for dithering RGB images into 216 colors. The offset of this ColorCube is 38. This color cube dithers blue values in the source image to one of 4 blue levels, green values to one of 9 green levels, and red values to one of 6 red levels. This is the default color cube for the ordered dither operation. |
| BYTE\_855 | A ColorCube with dimensions 8:5:5, useful for dithering YC~b~C~r~ images into 200 colors. The offset of this ColorCube is 54. This color cube dithers blue values in the source image to one of 8 blue levels, green values to one of 5 green levels, and red values to one of 5 red levels. |

These color cubes are specified by the `colorMap` parameter that is
required by the `OrderedDither` operation.

### 7.6.2 Performing the Lookup

The `lookup` operation performs a general table lookup on a rendered
or renderable image. The destination image is obtained by passing the
source image through the lookup table. The source image may be single-
or multi-banded of data types `byte`, `ushort`, `short`, or `int`. The
lookup table may be single- or multi-banded of any ImageN-supported data
types.

The destination image must have the same data type as the lookup
table, and its number of bands is determined based on the number of
bands of the source and the table. If the source is single-banded, the
destination has the same number of bands as the lookup table;
otherwise, the destination has the same number of bands as the source.

If either the source or the table is single-banded and the other one
is multi-banded, the single band is applied to every band of the
multi-banded object. If both are multi-banded, their corresponding
bands are matched up.

The table may have a set of offset values, one for each band. This
value is subtracted from the source pixel values before indexing into
the table data array.

It is the user\'s responsibility to make certain the lookup table
supplied is suitable for the source image. Specifically, the table
data must cover the entire range of the source data. Otherwise, the
result of this operation is undefined.

By the nature of this operation, the destination may have a different
number of bands and/or data type from the source. The `SampleModel` of
the destination is created in accordance with the actual lookup table
used in a specific case.

There are three specific cases of table lookup that determine the
pixel values of the destination image:

-   If the source image is single-banded and the lookup table is
    single- or multi-banded, the destination image has the same number
    of bands as the lookup table:


              for (int h = 0; h < dstHeight; h++) {
                  for (int w = 0; w < dstWidth; w++) {
                      for (int b = 0; b < dstNumBands; b++) {
                          dst[h][w][b] = table[b][src[h][w][0] - offsets[b]]
                      }
                  }
              }
         

-   If the source image is multi-banded and the lookup table is
    single-banded, the destination image has the same number of bands
    as the source image:


              for (int h = 0; h < dstHeight; h++) {
                  for (int w = 0; w < dstWidth; w++) {
                      for (int b = 0; b < dstNumBands; b++) {
                          dst[h][w][b] = table[0][src[h][w][b] - offsets[0]]
                     }
                   }
              }
         

-   If the source image is multi-banded and the lookup table is
    multi-banded, with the same number of bands as the source image,
    the destination image will have the same number of bands as the
    source image:


              for (int h = 0; h < dstHeight; h++) {
                  for (int w = 0; w < dstWidth; w++) {
                      for (int b = 0; b < dstNumBands; b++) {
                          dst[h][w][b] = table[b][src[h][w][b] - offsets[b]]
                      }
                  }
              }

The `lookup` operation takes one rendered or renderable source image
and one parameter:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Parameter   Type              Description
  --------------------- --------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  table      LookupTableJAI   The lookup table through which the source image is passed.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : 

See [Section 7.6.1, \"Creating the Lookup
Table](Image-enhance.doc.html#51408)\" for more information.

page 417](Examples.doc.html#73865).


### 7.6.3 Other Lookup Table Operations

7.7 Convolution Filtering
----------------------------------------------

Convolution filtering is often used to reduce the effects of noise in
images or to sharpen the detail in blurred images. Convolution
filtering is a form of *spatial filtering* that computes each output
sample by multiplying elements of a kernel with the samples
surrounding a particular source sample.

Convolution filtering operates on a group of input pixels surrounding
a center pixel. The adjoining pixels provide important information
about brightness trends in the area of the pixel being processed.

Convolution filtering moves across the source image, pixel by pixel,
placing resulting pixels into the destination image. The resulting
brightness of each source pixel depends on the group of pixels
surrounding the source pixel. Using the brightness information of the
source pixel\'s neighbors, the convolution process calculates the
spatial frequency activity in the area, making it possible to filter
the brightness based on the spatial frequency of the area.

Convolution filtering uses a *convolve kernel*, containing an array of
convolution coefficient values, called *key elements*, as shown in
[Figure 7-9](#figure-7-9). The array is not
restricted to any particular size, and does not even have to be
square. The kernel can be 1 x 1, 3 x 3, 5 x 5, `M` x `N, `and so on. A
larger kernel size affords a more precise filtering operation by
increasing the number of neighboring pixels used in the calculation.
However, the kernel cannot be bigger in any dimension than the image
data. Also, the larger the kernel, the more computations that are
required to be performed. For example, given a 640 x 480 image and a 3
x 3 kernel, the convolve operation requires over five million total
multiplications and additions.

The convolution filtering operation computes each output sample by
multiplying the key elements of the kernel with the samples
surrounding a particular source pixel. For each destination pixel, the
kernel is rotated 180 degrees and its key element is placed over the
source pixel corresponding with the destination pixel. The key
elements are multiplied with the source pixels under them, and the
resulting products are summed together to produce the destination
sample value.

The selection of the weights for the key elements determines the
nature of the filtering action, such as *high-pass* or *low-pass*. If
the values of the key elements are the reciprocal of the number of key
elements in the kernel (for example, 1/9 for a 3 x 3 kernel), the
result is a conventional low-pass averaging process. If the weights
are altered, certain pixels in the kernel will have an increased or
decreased influence in the average. [Figure
7-10](Image-enhance.doc.html#53832) shows three example convolve
filters, low-pass, high-pass, and Laplacian.

<a name="figure-7-9"></a>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Figure 7-10*  Convolve Filter Samples**

The low-pass filter, also known as a *box filter*, attenuates the
high-spatial frequency components of an image and has little affect on
the low-frequency components. The effect of passing an image through a
low-pass filter is a slight blurring. This is caused by attenuating
the sharp brightness transitions between edges and makes the image
appear to have less detail. See also [Section 7.7.2, \"Box
Filter](Image-enhance.doc.html#59705).\"

The high-pass filter has the opposite effect of the low-pass filter,
accentuating the high-frequency components and offering little affect
on the low-frequency components. The effect of passing an image
through a high-pass filter is a sharper image with increased detail in
the areas of brightness transition.

The Laplacian filter is another image detail sharpening filter that
works well for noise-free images. This filter subtracts the brightness
values of the four neighboring pixels from the central pixel. The
result of applying this filter is to reduce the gray level to zero.


### 7.7.1 Performing the Convolve Operation

The following example code shows a `convolve` operation on a single
sample `dst[x][y]`, which assumes that the kernel is of size `M` x `N`
and has already been rotated through 180 degrees. The kernel\'s key
element is located at position (`xKey`, `yKey`).

         dst[x][y] = 0;
             for (int i = -xOrigin; i < -xOrigin + width; i++) {
             for (int j = -yOrigin; j < -yOrigin + height; j++) {
               dst[x][y] += src[x + i][y + j]*kernel[xOrigin + i][yOrigin + j];
              }
         }

Convolution, or any neighborhood operation, leaves a band of pixels
around the edges undefined. For example, for a 3 x 3 kernel, only four
kernel elements and four source pixels contribute to the destination
pixel located at (0,0). Such pixels are not included in the
destination image. A border extension may be added via the
`BorderExtender` class. The type of border extension can be specified
as a `RenderingHint` to the `JAI.create` method. If no border
extension type is provided, a default extension of
`BorderExtender.BORDER_COPY` will be used to perform the extension.
See [Section 3.7.3, \"Rendering
Hints](Programming-environ.doc.html#55991).\"

The `convolve` operation takes one rendered source image and one
parameter:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Parameter   Type         Description
  --------------------- ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  kernel     KernelJAI   The convolution kernel. See [Section 6.9, \"Constructing a Kernel](Image-manipulation.doc.html#70882).\"\

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : 

The default `kernel` is `null`.

[Listing 7-5](#listing-7-5) shows a code sample for a `Convolve` operation.

***Listing 7-5*  Example Convolve Operation**  <a name="listing-7-5"></a>

```java
// Create the kernel.
kernel = new KernelJAI
float[] = {  0.0F, -1.0F,  0.0F,
            -1.0F,  5.0F, -1.0F,
             0.0F, -1.0F,  0.0F };

// Create the convolve operation.
im1 = JAI.create("convolve", im, kernel);
```

### 7.7.2 Box Filter

The `BoxFilter` operation is a special case of convolve operation in
which each source pixel contributes the same weight to the destination
pixel. The box filter operation determines the intensity of a pixel in
an image by averaging the source pixels within a rectangular area
around the pixel. The pixel values of the destination image are
defined by the following pseudocode:

```
int count = width * height; // # of pixels in the box
for (int b = 0; b < numBands; b++) {
     int total = 0;
     for (int j = -yKey; j < -yKey + height; j++) {
          for (int i = -xKey; i < -xKey + width; i++) {
              total += src[x+i][y+j][b];
           }
      }
     dst[x][y][b] = (total + count/2) / count; // round
}
```

The `BoxFilter` operation uses a low-pass filter that passes (leaves
untouched) the low spatial frequency components of the image and
attenuates the high-frequency components. In an area of the image that
has constant brightness, the brightness values are passed untouched.
When the filter passes over an area of sharp black to white
transitions, the brightness range is greatly attenuated.

Convolution, like any neighborhood operation, leaves a band of pixels
around the edges undefined. For example, for a 3 x 3 kernel, only four
kernel elements and four source pixels contribute to the convolution
pixel at the corners of the source image. Pixels that do not allow the
full kernel to be applied to the source are not included in the
destination image. A `Border` operation (see [Section 7.2, \"Adding
Borders to Images](Image-enhance.doc.html#68364)\") may be used to add
an appropriate border to the source image to avoid shrinkage of the
image boundaries.

The kernel may not be bigger in any dimension than the image data.

The `BoxFilter` operation takes one rendered source image and four
parameters:

| Parameters | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------| 
| width    | Integer | The width of the box. |
| height   | Integer | The height of the box. |
| xKey     | Integer | The *x* position of the key element. |
| yKey     | Integer | The *y* position of the key element. |

The `width` parameter is required. The remaining parameters may be
`null` and, if not supplied, default to the following values:

![](Image-enhance.doc.anc13.gif)

[Listing 7-6](#listing-7-7) shows a code sample for a
`BoxFilter` operation.

***Listing 7-6*  Example BoxFilter Operation**  <a name="listing-7-6"></a>

```java
// Read the arguments.
String fileName = args.length 0 ? args[0] : DEFAULT_FILE;
int width = args.length 1 ?
    Integer.decode(args[1]).intValue() : DEFAULT_SIZE;
int height = args.length 2 ?
    Integer.decode(args[2]).intValue() : width;

new BoxFilterExample(fileName, width, height);
}

public BoxFilterExample(String fileName, int width, int height)

// Load the image.
RenderedOp src =  JAI.create("fileload", fileName);

// Create the BoxFilter operation.
RenderedOp dst = JAI.create("boxfilter", src,
                            width, height,
                            width/2, height/2);
```

7.8 Median Filtering
-----------------------------------------

A median filter is used to remove impulse noise spikes from an image
and thus smoothing the image. Impulse noise spikes appear as bright or
dark pixels randomly distributed throughout the image. Noise spikes
are normally significantly brighter or darker than their neighboring
pixels and can easily be found by comparing the median value of a
group of input pixels.

The median filter is a neighborhood-based ranking filter in which the
pixels in the neighborhood are ranked in the order of their levels.
The median value of the group is then stored in the output pixel. The
resulting image is then free of pixel brightnesses that are at the
extremes in each input group of pixels.

The noise-reducing effect that the median filter has on an image
depends on two related things: the spatial extent of the neighborhood
(the mask) and the number of pixels involved in the computation. The
`MedianFilter` operation supports three different mask shapes, a
square, a plus, and an X-shape, as shown in [Figure
7-11](Image-enhance.doc.html#66848).

<a name="figure-7-11"></a>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](Image-enhance.doc.anc2.gif)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Figure 7-11*  Median Filter Masks**

The `MedianFilter` operation may also be used to compute the
*separable median* of a 3 x 3 or 5 x 5 region of pixels. The separable
median is defined as the median of the medians of each row. For
example, if the pixel values in a 3 x 3 window are as follows:


------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](Image-enhance.doc.anc4.gif)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

the overall (non-separable) median value is 5, while the separable
median is equal to the median of the three row medians: median(1, 2,
3) = 2, median(5, 6, 7) = 6, and median(4, 8, 9) = 8, yielding an
overall median of 6. The separable median may be obtained by
specifying a mask of type `MEDIAN_MASK_SQUARE_SEPARABLE`.

The `MedianFilter` operation takes one rendered source image and two
parameters:

| Parameters | Type | Default |Description |
|------------|------|---------|------------|
| maskShape | Integer | MASK\_SQUARE | The shape of the mask to be used for Median Filtering |
| maskSize  | Integer | 3            | The size (width and height) of the mask to be used in Median Filtering. |

The `maskShape` parameter is one of the following:

| maskShape      |        Description      |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| MEDIAN\_MASK\_SQUARE   | A square-shaped mask. The default. |
| MEDIAN\_MASK\_PLUS     | A plus-shaped mask. |
| MEDIAN\_MASK\_X        | An X-shaped mask. |
| MEDIAN\_MASK\_SQUARE\_SEPARABLE | A separable square mask, used for the separable median operation. |

The `maskSize` parameter must be 1 (1 x 1) or greater. The default
value, if one is not provided, is 3 (3 x 3). For large masks, the
noise reduction effect of more pixels used in the computation of the
median value reaches a point of diminishing returns. Typical mask
sizes are 3 x 3 and 5 x 5.


7.9 Frequency Domain Processing
----------------------------------------------------

Images contain spatial details that are seen as brightness
transitions, cycling from dark to light and back to dark. The rate at
which the transitions occur in an image represent the image\'s
*spatial frequency*.

An image\'s spatial frequency can be measured horizontally,
vertically, or at any diagonal in between. An image contains many
spatial frequencies that, when combined in the correct magnitude and
phase, form the complex details of the image.

A *frequency transform* decomposes an image from its spatial domain
form of brightness into a frequency domain form of fundamental
frequency components. Each frequency component contains a magnitude
and phase value. An *inverse frequency transform* converts an image
from its frequency form back to its spatial form.


### 7.9.1 Fourier Transform

ImageN supports the most common type of frequency transform, the
*discrete Fourier transform* and its inverse, the inverse discrete
Fourier transform. The discrete Fourier transform of an image is a
two-dimensional process. The result of the transform is a
two-dimensional array of values, each having two parts: real and
imaginary. Each value represents a distinct spatial frequency
component. The frequency-transform image has as many values as there
are pixels in the source image.

The real portion of the values can be displayed as an image, visually
showing the frequency components of the source image. The result is in
\"wrap around\" order, with the zero-frequency point (also known as
\"DC\" for direct current) at the upper left corner and the high
frequencies at the center.


#### 7.9.1.1 Discrete Fourier Transform

The `DFT` (discrete Fourier transform) operation computes the discrete
Fourier transform of an image. A negative exponential is used as the
basis function for the transform. The operation supports
real-to-complex, complex-to-complex, and complex-to-real transforms. A
complex image must have an even number of bands, with the even bands
(0, 2, etc.) representing the real parts and the odd bands (1, 3,
etc.) the imaginary parts of each complex pixel.

If an underlying fast Fourier transform (FFT) implementation is used
that requires that the image dimensions be powers of 2, the width and
height may each be increased to the power of 2 greater than or equal
to the original width and height, respectively.

The `dft` operation takes one rendered or renderable source image and
two parameters.

| Parameters | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------| 
| scalingType | Integer | The type of scaling to perform. One of DFTDescriptor.SCALING\_NONE, DFTDescriptor.SCALING\_UNITARY, or DFTDescriptor.SCALING\_DIMENSIONS. |
| dataNature | Integer | The nature of the data. One of DFTDescriptor.REAL\_TO\_COMPLEX, DFTDescriptor.COMPLEX\_TO\_COMPLEX, or DFTDescriptor.COMPLEX\_TO\_REAL. |

The default parameters for this operation are `SCALING_NONE` and `REAL_TO_COMPLEX`.

The `scalingType` parameter defines how the image dimensions may be
scaled, as follows:

| scalingType      | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| DFTDescriptor.SCALING\_NONE       | The transform is not to be scaled (the default). |
| DFTDescriptor.SCALING\_UNITARY    | The transform is to be scaled by the square root of the product of its dimensions. |
| DFTDescriptor.SCALING\_DIMENSIONS | The transform is to be scaled by the product of its dimensions. |

The `dataNature` parameter specifies the nature of the source and
destination data, as follows.

| dataNature      | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| DFTDescriptor.REAL\_TO\_COMPLEX     | The source data are real and the destination data complex. |
| DFTDescriptor.COMPLEX\_TO\_COMPLEX  | The source and destination data are both complex. |
| DFTDescriptor.COMPLEX\_TO\_REAL     | The source data are complex and the destination data real. |

If the source data are complex, the number of bands in the source
image must be a multiple of 2. The number of bands in the destination
must match that which would be expected given the number of bands in
the source image and the specified nature of the source and
destination data. If the source image is real, the number of bands in
the destination will be twice that in the source. If the destination
image is real, the number of bands in the destination will be half
that in the source. Otherwise the number of bands in the source and
destination must be equal.

The `DFT` operation defines a `PropertyGenerator` that sets the
`COMPLEX` property of the image to `FALSE` if the `dataNature`
parameter is `COMPLEX_TO_REAL` and to `TRUE` if the `dataNature`
parameter is `REAL_TO_COMPLEX` or `COMPLEX_TO_COMPLEX`. The value of
this property may be retrieved by calling the getProperty() method
with `COMPLEX` as the property name.

#### 7.9.1.2 Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform

The `IDFT` (inverse discrete Fourier transform) operation computes the
inverse discrete Fourier transform of an image. A positive exponential
is used as the basis function for the transform. The operation
supports real-to-complex, complex-to-complex, and complex-to-real
transforms. A complex image must have an even number of bands, with
the even bands (0, 2, etc.) representing the real parts and the odd
bands (1, 3, etc.) the imaginary parts of each complex pixel.

If an underlying fast Fourier transform (FFT) implementation is used
that requires that the image dimensions be powers of 2, the width and
height may each be increased to the power of 2 greater than or equal
to the original width and height, respectively.

The `IDFT` operation takes one rendered or renderable source image and
two parameters.

| Parameters | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------| 
| scalingType | Integer | The type of scaling to perform. One of DFTDescriptor.SCALING\_NONE, DFTDescriptor.SCALING\_UNITARY, or DFTDescriptor.SCALING\_DIMENSIONS. |
| dataNature | Integer | The nature of the data. One of DFTDescriptor.REAL\_TO\_COMPLEX, DFTDescriptor.COMPLEX\_TO\_COMPLEX, or DFTDescriptor.COMPLEX\_TO\_REAL. |

The default parameters for this operation are `SCALING_DIMENSIONS` and `COMPLEX_TO_REAL`.

The `scalingType` parameter defines how the image dimensions may be
scaled, as follows:

| scalingType      | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| DFTDescriptor.SCALING\_NONE       | The transform is not to be scaled. |
| DFTDescriptor.SCALING\_UNITARY    | The transform is to be scaled by the square root of the product of its dimensions. |
| DFTDescriptor.SCALING\_DIMENSIONS | The transform is to be scaled by the product of its dimensions (the default). |

The `dataNature` parameter specifies the nature of the source and
destination data, as follows.

| dataNature      | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| DFTDescriptor.REAL\_TO\_COMPLEX    | The source data are real and the destination data complex. |
| DFTDescriptor.COMPLEX\_TO\_COMPLEX | The source and destination data are both complex. |
| DFTDescriptor.COMPLEX\_TO\_REAL    | The source data are complex and the destination data real. |

If the source data are complex, the number of bands in the source
image must be a multiple of 2. The number of bands in the destination
must match that which would be expected given the number of bands in
the source image and the specified nature of the source and
destination data. If the source image is real, the number of bands in
the destination will be twice that in the source. If the destination
image is real, the number of bands in the destination will be half
that in the source. Otherwise the number of bands in the source and
destination must be equal.

The `IDFT` operation defines a `PropertyGenerator` that sets the
`COMPLEX` property of the image to `FALSE` if the `dataNature`
parameter is `COMPLEX_TO_REAL` and to `TRUE` if the `dataNature`
parameter is `REAL_TO_COMPLEX` or `COMPLEX_TO_COMPLEX`. The value of
this property may be retrieved by calling the getProperty() method
with `COMPLEX` as the property name.


### 7.9.2 Cosine Transform

The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is similar to the discrete Fourier
transform (see [Section 7.9.1.1, \"Discrete Fourier
Transform](Image-enhance.doc.html#64002)\"). However, the DCT is
better at compactly representing very small images. Like the discrete
Fourier transform (DFT), the DCT also has an inverse operation, the
*inverse discrete cosine transform* (IDCT).


#### 7.9.2.1 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)

The `DCT` operation computes the even discrete cosine transform of an
image. Each band of the destination image is derived by performing a
two-dimensional DCT on the corresponding band of the source image.

The `DCT` operation takes one rendered or renderable source image and
no parameters.

[Listing 7-8](#listing-7-8) shows a code sample for a
DCT operation.

***Listing 7-8*  Example DCT Operation**  <a name="listing-7-8"></a>

```java
// Load the source image.
RenderedImage src = (RenderedImage)JAI.create("fileload",
                    fileName);

// Calculate a DCT image from the source image.
ParameterBlock pb = (new ParameterBlock()).addSource(src);
PlanarImage dct = JAI.create("dct", pb, null);

// Get the DCT image data.
int width = dct.getWidth();
int height = dct.getHeight();
int numBands = dct.getSampleModel().getNumBands();
int dataType = dct.getSampleModel().getDataType();
double[] dctData =
    dct.getData().getPixels(0, 0, width, height,
                           (double[])null);
double[] pixels = new double[dctData.length];
```

#### 7.9.2.2 Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT)

The `IDCT` operation computes the inverse even discrete cosine
transform of an image. Each band of the destination image is derived
by performing a two-dimensional inverse DCT on the corresponding band
of the source image.

The `IDCT` operation takes one rendered or renderable source image and
no parameters.

[Listing 7-9](#listing-7-9) shows a code sample for an
operation that first takes the discrete cosine transform of an image,
then computes the inverse discrete cosine transform.

***Listing 7-9*  Example IDCT Operation**  <a name="listing-7-9"></a>

```java
// Calculate a DCT image from the source image.
System.out.println("Creating DCT of source image ...");
ParameterBlock pb = (new ParameterBlock()).addSource(src);
PlanarImage dct = JAI.create("dct", pb, null);

// Calculate an IDCT image from the DCT image.
System.out.println("Creating IDCT of DCT of source image ...");
pb = (new ParameterBlock()).addSource(dct);
PlanarImage idct = JAI.create("idct", pb, null);

// Create display image for inverse DCT of DCT of source image.
System.out.println("Creating display image for IDCT of DCT");
pixels = idct.getData().getPixels(0, 0, width, height,
                                  (double[])pixels);
BufferedImage bi = createBI(colorImage, width, height, pixels);
```

### 7.9.3 Magnitude Enhancement

The `magnitude` operation computes the magnitude of each pixel of a
complex image. The source image must have an even number of bands,
with the even bands (0, 2, etc.) representing the real parts and the
odd bands (1, 3, etc.) the imaginary parts of each complex pixel. The
destination image has at most half the number of bands of the source
image with each sample in a pixel representing the magnitude of the
corresponding complex source sample.

The magnitude values of the destination image are defined by the
following pseudocode:

         dstPixel[x][y][b] = sqrt(src[x][y][2b]2 + src[x][y][2b + 1]2)

:   where the number of bands *b* varies from zero to one less than
    the number of bands in the destination image.

For integral image data types, the result is rounded and clamped as
needed.

The `magnitude` operation takes one rendered or renderable source
image containing complex data and no parameters.

[Listing 7-10](#listing-7-10) shows a code sample for a `magnitude` operation.

***Listing 7-10*  Example Magnitude Operation**  <a name="listing-7-10"></a>

```java
// Calculate a DFT image from the source image.
pb = new ParameterBlock();
pb.addSource(src).add(DFTDescriptor.SCALING_NONE);
PlanarImage dft = JAI.create("dft", pb, null);

// Create the ParameterBlock specifying the source image.
pb = new ParameterBlock();
pb.addSource(dft);

// Calculate the magnitude.
PlanarImage magnitude = JAI.create("magnitude", pb, null);
```

### 7.9.4 Magnitude-squared Enhancement

The `MagnitudeSquared` operation computes the squared magnitude of
each pixel of a complex image. The source image must have an even
number of bands, with the even bands (0, 2, etc.) representing the
real parts and the odd bands (1, 3, etc.) the imaginary parts of each
complex pixel. The destination image has at most half the number of
bands of the source image with each sample in a pixel representing the
magnitude of the corresponding complex source sample.

The squared magnitude values of the destination image are defined by
the following pseudocode:

```
dstPixel[x][y][b] = src[x][y][2b]2 + src[x][y][2b + 1]2
```
Where the number of bands *b* varies from zero to one less than the number of bands in the destination image.

For integral image data types, the result is rounded and clamped as
needed.

The `MagnitudeSquared` operation takes one rendered or renderable
source image containing complex data and no parameters.


### 7.9.5 Phase Enhancement

The `Phase` operation computes the phase angle of each pixel of a
complex image. The source image must have an even number of bands,
with the even bands (0, 2, etc.) representing the real parts and the
odd bands (1, 3, etc.) the imaginary parts of each complex pixel. The
destination image has at most half the number of bands of the source
image with each sample in a pixel representing the phase angle of the
corresponding complex source sample.

The angle values of the destination image are defined by the following
pseudocode:

         dst[x][y][b] = atan2(src[x][y][2b + 1], src[x][y][2b])

:   where the number of bands *b* varies from zero to one less than
    the number of bands in the destination image.

For integral image data types, the result is rounded and scaled so the
\"natural\" arctangent range from \[-𝜋,𝜋) is remapped into the range \[0, MAXVALUE).
The result for floating point image data types is the value returned
by the `atan2()` method.

The `phase` operation takes one rendered or renderable source image
containing complex data and no parameters.


### 7.9.6 Complex Conjugate

The `Conjugate` operation computes the complex conjugate of a complex
image. The operation negates the imaginary components of a rendered or
renderable source image containing complex data. The source image must
contain an even number of bands with the even-indexed bands (0, 2,
etc.) representing the real and the odd-indexed bands (1, 3, etc.) the
imaginary parts of each pixel. The destination image similarly
contains an even number of bands with the same interpretation and with
contents defined by:

         dst[x][y][2*k]   =  src[x][y][2*k];
         dst[x][y][2*k+1] = -src[x][y][2*k+1];

:   where the index *k* varies from zero to one less than the number
    of complex components in the destination image.

The `Conjugate` operation takes one rendered or renderable source
image containing complex data and no parameters.


### 7.9.7 Periodic Shift

The `PeriodicShift` operation computes the periodic translation of an
image. The destination image of the `PeriodicShift` operation is the
infinite periodic extension of the source image with horizontal and
vertical periods equal to the image width and height, respectively,
shifted by a specified amount along each axis and clipped to the
bounds of the source image. Thus for each band *b* the destination
image sample at location (*x*,*y*) is defined by:

```java
if(x < width - shiftX) {
    if(y < height - shiftY) {
        dst[x][y][b] = src[x + shiftX][y + shiftY][b];
    } else {
        dst[x][y][b] = src[x + shiftX][y - height + shiftY][b];
    }
} else {
    if(y < height - shiftY) {
        dst[x][y][b] = src[x - width + shiftX][y + shiftY][b];
    } else {
        dst[x][y][b] = src[x - width + shiftX][y - height +
                                               shiftY][b];
    }
}
```
Where `shiftX` and `shiftY` denote the translation factors along the *x* and *y* axes, respectively.

The `PeriodicShift` operation takes one rendered or renderable source
image and two parameters.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| shiftX    | Integer | The displacement in the *x* direction. |
| shiftY    | Integer | The displacement in the *y* direction. |
 
### 7.9.8 Polar to Complex

The `PolarToComplex` operation computes a complex image from a
magnitude and a phase image. The operation creates an image with
complex-valued pixels from two images, the respective pixel values of
which represent the magnitude (modulus) and phase of the corresponding
complex pixel in the destination image.

The source images should have the same number of bands. The first
source image contains the magnitude values and the second source image
the phase values. The destination will have twice as many bands with
the even-indexed bands (0, 2, etc.) representing the real and the
odd-indexed bands (1, 3, etc.) the imaginary parts of each pixel.

The pixel values of the destination image are defined for a given
complex sample by the following pseudocode:

         dst[x][y][2*b]   = src0[x][y][b]*Math.cos(src1[x][y][b])
         dst[x][y][2*b+1] = src0[x][y][b]*Math.sin(src1[x][y][b])

:   where the index *b* varies from zero to one less than the number
    of bands in the source images.

For phase images with integral data type, it is assumed that the
actual phase angle is scaled from the range \[-`PI`, `PI`\] to the
range \[0, `MAX_VALUE`\] where `MAX_VALUE` is the maximum value of the
data type in question.

The `PolarToComplex` operation takes two rendered or renderable source
images and no parameters.


### 7.9.9 Images Based on a Functional Description

The `ImageFunction` operation generates an image from a functional
description. This operation permits the creation of images on the
basis of a functional specification, which is provided by an object
that is an instance of a class that implements the
`org.eclipse.imagen.ImageFunction` interface. In other words, to use this
operation, a class containing the functional information must be
created and this class must implement the `ImageFunction` interface.

The `ImageFunction` interface merely defines the minimal set of
methods required to represent such a function. The actual
implementation of a class implementing this interface is left to the
programmer.

For example, if the function you wanted to generate was the negative
exponential

             exp(-|x| - |y|)

The `org.eclipse.imagen.ImageFunction` implementation would return the
following values:

-   `isComplex()` would return false


-   `getNumElements()` would return 1


-   `float[] real = new real[width*height];getElements(x, y, width, height, real, null);`

and the implementation would initialize the array `real` such that

         real[j*width + i] = exp(-|x + i| - |y + j|)

or, equivalently

         real[k] = exp(-|x + (k % width)]| - |y + (k / width)|)

:   where 0 ≤ k \< width\*height.

The (*x*,*y*) coordinates passed to the `ImageFunction.getElements()`
methods are derived by applying an optional translation and scaling to
the image *x* and *y* coordinates. The image *x* and *y* coordinates
as usual depend on the values of the minimum *x* and *y* coordinates
of the image, which need not be zero.

Specifically, the function coordinates passed to `getElements()` are
calculated from the image coordinates as:

         functionX = xScale*imageX + xTrans;
         functionY = yScale*imageY + yTrans;

The number of bands in the destination image will be equal to the
value returned by the `ImageFunction.getNumElements()` method unless
the `ImageFunction.isComplex()` method returns `true`, in which case
it will be twice that. The data type of the destination image is
determined by the `SampleModel` specified by an `ImageLayout` object
provided via a hint. If no layout hint is provided, the data type will
default to single-precision floating point.

The double precision floating point form of the `getElements()` method
will be invoked if and only if the data type is specified to be
`double`. For all other data types the single precision form of
`getElements()` will be invoked and the destination sample values will
be clamped to the data type of the image.

The `ImageFunction` operation takes seven parameters.

| Parameter      | Type | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| function | ImageFunction | The functional description. |
| width    | Integer       | The image width. |
| height   | Integer       | The image height. |
| xScale   | Float         | The *x* scale factor. |
| yScale   | Float         | The *y* scale factor. |
| xTrans   | Float         | The *x* translation. |
| yTrans   | Float         | The *y* translation. |

The image width and height are provided explicitly as parameters.
These values override the width and height specified by an
`ImageLayout` if such is provided.

**API:** `org.eclipse.imagen.ImageFunction`

* `boolean isComplex();`
* `int getNumElements();`
* `void getElements(float startX, float startY, float deltaX, 
       float deltaY, int countX, int countY, int element, 
       float[]  real, float[] imag);`
* `void getElements(double startX, double startY, double deltaX, 
       double deltaY, int countX, int countY, int element, 
       double[]  real, double[] imag);`

7.10 Single-image Pixel Point Processing
-------------------------------------------------------------

Pixel point operations are the most basic, yet necessary image
processing operations. The pixel point operations are primarily
contrast enhancement operations that alter the gray levels of an
image\'s pixels. One-by-one, the gray level of each pixel in the
source image is modified to a new value, usually by a mathematical
relationship.

ImageN supports the following single-image pixel point operations:

-   Pixel inverting (`Invert`)

-   Logarithmic enhancement (`Log`)


### 7.10.1 Pixel Inverting

The `Invert` operation inverts the pixel values of an image. For
source images with signed data types, the pixel values of the
destination image are defined by the following pseudocode:

```
dst[x][y][b] = -src[x][y][b]
```

For unsigned data types, the destination values are defined by the
following pseudocode:

```
dst[x][y][b] = MAX_VALUE - src[x][y][b]
```

Where `MAX_VALUE` is the maximum value supported by the system of the data type of the source pixel.

The `Invert` operation takes one rendered or renderable source image
and no parameters.

[Figure 7-12](Image-enhance.doc.html#76289) shows a simple example of
an `Invert` operation.

<a name="figure-7-12"></a>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](Image-enhance.doc.ancA7.gif)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Figure 7-12* Pixel Inverting**


### 7.10.2 Logarithmic Enhancement

Occasionally, it is desirable to quantize an image on a logarithmic
scale rather than a linear scale. The human eye has a logarithmic
intensity response but some images are digitized by equipment that
quantizes the samples on a linear scale. To make the image better for
use by a human observer, these images may be made to have a
logarithmic response by the `Log` operation.

The `Log` operation takes the logarithm of the pixel values of the
source image. The pixel values of the destination image are defined by
the following pseudocode:

```
dst[x][y][b] = java.lang.Math.log(src[x][y][b])
```

For integral image data types, the result is rounded and clamped as
needed. For all integral data types, the log of 0 is set to 0. For
signed integral data types (`short` and `int`), the log of a negative
pixel value is set to -1. For all floating point data types (`float`
and `double`), the log of 0 is set to -`Infinity`, and the log of a
negative pixel value is set to `NaN`.

The `Log` operation takes one rendered or renderable source image and
no parameters.

[Listing 7-11](#listing-7-11) shows a code sample for a `Log` operation.

***Listing 7-11*  Example Log Operation**  <a name="listing-7-11"></a>

```java
// Create the ParameterBlock specifying the source image.
pb = new ParameterBlock();
pb.addSource(image);

// Create the Log operation.
RenderedImage dst = JAI.create("log", pb);
```

7.11 Dual Image Pixel Point Processing
-----------------------------------------------------------

The previous section described pixel point operations for single
images. This section deals with pixel point processing on two images,
also known as *dual-image point processing*. Dual-image point
processing maps two pixel brightnesses, one from each image, to an
output image.

ImageN supports the following dual-image pixel point operations:

-   Overlay images (`Overlay` operation)


-   Image compositing (`Composite` operation)


### 7.11.1 Overlay Images

The `Overlay` operation takes two rendered or renderable source
images, and overlays the second source image on top of the first
source image. Usually, the images are identical scenes, but may have
been acquired at different times through different spectral filters.

The two source images must have the same data type and number of
bands. However, their `SampleModel` types may differ. The destination
image will always have the same bounding rectangle as the first source
image, that is, the image on the bottom, and the same data type and
number of bands as the two source images. If the two source images
don\'t intersect, the destination will be the same as the first
source.

The `Overlay` operation is defined by the following pseudocode:

         if (srcs[1] contains the point (x, y)) {
             dst[x][y][b] = srcs[1][x][y][b];
         } else {
             dst[x][y][b] = srcs[0][x][y][b];
         }

The `Overlay` operation takes two rendered or renderable source images
and no parameters.


### 7.11.2 Image Compositing

The `Composite` operation merges unrelated objects from two images.
The result is a new image that didn\'t exist before. The `Composite`
operation combines two images based on their alpha values at each
pixel. This is done on a per-band basis, and the source images are
expected to have the same number of bands and the same data type. The
destination image has the same data type as the two sources, but one
extra band than the source images, which represents the result alpha
channel.

The destination pixel values may be viewed as representing a
fractional pixel coverage or transparency factor. Specifically, the
`Composite` operation implements the Porter-Duff \"over\"
rule <sup>1</sup>, in which the output color of a pixel with source
value and alpha tuples (*A*, *a*) and (*B*, *b*) is given by:

<sup>1</sup> See *Computer Graphics*, July 1984 pp. 253-259.

:   *a*\**A* + (1 - *a*)\*(*b*\**B*)

The output alpha value is given by:

:   *a* + (1 - *a*)\**b*

For premultiplied sources tuples (*a*\**A*, *a*) and (*b*\**B*, *b*),
the premultiplied output value is simply:

:   (*a*\**A*) + (1 - *a*)\*(*b*\**B*)

The color channels of the two source images are supplied via `source1`
and `source2`. The two sources must either both be pre-multiplied by
alpha or not. Alpha channel should not be included in `source1` and
`source2`.

The `Composite` operation takes two rendered or renderable source
images and four parameters:

| Parameter      | Type | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| source1Alpha        | PlanarImage | An alpha image to override the alpha for the first source.
| source2Alpha        | PlanarImage | An alpha image to override the alpha for the second source.
| alphaPremultiplied  | Boolean     | True if alpha has been premultiplied to both sources and the destination.
| destAlpha           | Integer     | Indicates if the destination image should include an extra alpha channel, and if so, whether it should be the first or last band. One of: CompositeDescriptor.DESTINATION\_ALPHA\_FIRST CompositeDescriptor.DESTINATION\_ALPHA\_LAST CompositeDescriptor.NO\_DESTINATION\_ALPHA |

The alpha channel of the first source images must be supplied via the
`source1Alpha` parameter. This parameter may not be null. The alpha
channel of the second source image may be supplied via the
`source2Alpha` parameter. This parameter may be null, in which case
the second source is considered completely opaque. The alpha images
should be single-banded, and have the same data type as the source
image.

The `alphaPremultiplied` parameter indicates whether or not the
supplied alpha image is premultiplied to both the source images.

The destination image is the combination of the two source images. It
has the color channels and one additional alpha channel (the band
index depends on the `alphaFirst` parameter). Whether the alpha value
is pre-multiplied to the color channels also depends on the value of
`alphaPremultiplied` (pre-multiplied if true).

[Listing 7-12](#listing-7-12) shows a code sample for a
composite operation.

***Listing 7-12*  Example Composite Operation**  <a name="listing-7-12"></a>

```java
// Get the first image.
pb = new ParameterBlock();
pb.add(s1);
RenderedImage src1 = (RenderedImage)JAI.create("jpeg", pb);

// Get the second image
pb = new ParameterBlock();
pb.add(s2);
RenderedImage src2 = (RenderedImage)JAI.create("jpeg", pb);

// Create the ParameterBlock
pb = new ParameterBlock();
pb.addSource(src1);
pb.addSource(src2);
pb.add(new Boolean(false));
pb.add(new Boolean(false));

// Create the composite operation.
RenderedImage dst = (RenderedImage)JAI.create("composite", pb);
```

7.12 Thresholding
--------------------------------------

Thresholding, also known as *binary contrast enhancement*, provides a
simple means of defining the boundaries of objects that appear on a
contrasting background. The `Threshold` operation takes one rendered
image, and maps all the pixels of this image whose values fall within
a specified range to a specified constant. The range is specified by a
low value and a high value.

The pixel values of the destination image are defined by the following
pseudocode:

```
lowVal = (low.length < dstNumBands) ?
          low[0] : low[b];
highVal = (high.length < dstNumBands) ?
           high[0] : high[b];
const = (constants.length < dstNumBands) ?
         constants[0] : constants[b];

if (src[x][y][b] >= lowVal && src[x][y][b] <= highVal) {
    dst[x][y][b] = const;
} else {
    dst[x][y][b] = src[x][y][b];
}
```

The `Threshold` operation takes one rendered or renderable source
image and three parameters:

| Parameter      | Type | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| low            | double\[\] | The low value. |
| high           | double\[\] | The high value |

If the number of elements supplied via the `high`, `low`, and
`constants` arrays are less than the number of bands of the source
image, the element from entry 0 is applied to all the bands.
Otherwise, the element from a different entry is applied to its
corresponding band.

The `low` parameter defines the lower bound for the `threshold`
operation for each band of the image. The operation will affect only
values greater than or equal to `low[0]` in band 0, only values
greater than or equal to `low[1]` in band 1, and so on. The `high`
parameter defines the upper bound for the `threshold` operation for
each band of the image.

A common way to arrive at the optimal values for the `low` and `high`
parameters is to perform an `extrema` operation on the image (see
[Section 9.3, \"Finding the Extrema of an
Image](Analysis.doc.html#54907)\").

[Listing 7-13](#listing-7-13) shows a code sample for a
`threshold` operation in which the three parameters are passed as
arguments to the operation.

***Listing 7-13*  Example Threshold Operation** <a name="listing-7-13"></a>

```java
// Set up the operation parameters.
PlanarImage src, dst;
Integer [] low, high, map;
int bands;

low  = new Integer[bands];
high = new Integer[bands];
map  = new Integer[bands];

for (int i = 0; i < bands; i++) {
   low[i]  = new Integer(args[1]);
   high[i] = new Integer(args[2]);
   map[i]  = new Integer(args[3]);
}

// Create the threshold operation.
pb = new ParameterBlock();
pb.addSource(src);
pb.add(low);
pb.add(high);
pb.add(map);
RenderedImage dst = JAI.create("threshold", pb);
```
