# Introduction to Eclipse ImageN

THe Java programming language has continued to grow both in
popularity and scope since its initial release. Java in its current
form is the culmination of several years work, dating back to 1991
when it was conceived as a modular and extensible programming
language.

Java is based on the C and C++ programming languages, but differs from
these languages is some important ways. The main difference between
C/C++ and Java is that in Java all development is done with objects
and classes. This main difference provides distinct advantages for
programs written in Java, such as multiple threads of control and
dynamic loading.

Another advantage to Java is its extensibility. Since the original
release of Java, several extensions have been added to the core code,
providing greater flexibility and power to applications. These
extensions add objects and classes that improve the Java programmer\'s
ability to use such features as:

-   Java Swing - a component set to create grapical user interfaces with a cross-platform look and feel.

-   Java Sound - for high-quality 32-channel audio rendering and MIDI-controlled sound synthesis

-   Java 3D - for advanced geometry and 3D spatial sound

-   Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) - for image processing and analysis

-   Java Media Framework - for components to play and control time-based media such as audio and video

-   Java Telephony (JTAPI) - for computer-telephony applications

-   Java Speech - for including speech technology into Java applets and applications

Java 2 introduced *extensions* to enable the runtime to find and load extension classes without the extension classes having to be named on the classpath.

In *Java 9* the *Jigsaw module system* was introduced, replacing the *extensions* system.

1.1 The Evolution of Imaging in Java
---------------------------------------------------------

Early versions of the *Java AWT* provided a simple rendering package
suitable for rendering common HTML pages, but without the features
necessary for complex imaging. The early AWT allowed the generation of
simple images by drawing lines and shapes. A very limited number of
image files, such as GIF and JPEG, could be read in through the use of
a `Toolkit` object. Once read in, the image could be displayed, but
there were essentially no image processing operators.

The *Java 2D API* extended the early AWT by adding support for more
general graphics and rendering operations. Java 2D added special
graphics classes for the definition of geometric primitives, text
layout and font definition, color spaces, and image rendering. The new
classes supported a limited set of image processing operators for
blurring, geometric transformation, sharpening, contrast enhancement,
and thresholding. *The Java 2D extensions were added to the core Java
AWT beginning with the Java Platform 1.2 release.*

The *Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) API* further extends the Java platform
(including the Java 2D API) by allowing sophisticated, high-performance
image processing to be incorporated. *JAI was released as Java Extension
and can also be used as a standalone library.* 

The *Eclipse ImageN* library has adapted the *Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) API* 
codebase into a standalone open source project. *ImageN is released as an open source
project for use as a Java library or Java "jigsaw" module.*

* ImageN is a set of classes providing imaging functionality beyond that of Java 2D and
the Java Foundation classes, while remaining compatible with those APIs.

* ImageN offers a set of core image processing capabilities including
image tiling, regions of interest, and deferred execution.

* ImageN provides a set of core image processing operators including many common
point, area, and frequency-domain operators.

*Eclipse ImageN* is intended to meet the needs of all imaging applications. The API
is highly extensible, allowing new image processing operations to be added in such a
way as to appear to be a native part of it.

1.2 Why Another Imaging API?
-------------------------------------------------

Several imaging APIs have been developed - a few have even been
marketed and been fairly successful. However, none of these APIs have
been universally accepted because they failed to address specific
segments of the imaging market or they lacked the power to meet
specific needs. As a consequence, many organizations have had to \"roll
their own\" in an attempt to meet their specific requirements.

Writing a custom imaging API is a very expensive and time-consuming
task and the customized API often has to be rewritten whenever a new
CPU or operating system comes along, creating a maintenance nightmare.
How much simpler it would be to have an imaging API that meets
everyone\'s needs.

Previous industry and academic experience in the design of image
processing libraries, the usefulness of these libraries across a wide
variety of application domains, and the feedback from the users of
these libraries have been incorporated into the design of JAI.

Eclipse ImageN is intended to support image processing using the Java programming
language as generally as possible so that few, if any, image
processing applications are beyond its reach. At the same time, Eclipse ImageN
presents a simple programming model that can be readily used in
applications without a tremendous mechanical programming overhead or a
requirement that the programmer be expert in all phases of the API\'s
design.

Eclipse ImageN encapsulates image data formats and remote method invocations
within a re-usable image data object, allowing an image file, a
network image object, or a real-time data stream to be processed
identically. Thus, ImageN represents a simple programming model while
concealing the complexity of the internal mechanisms.

1.3 Eclipse ImageN Features
-----------------------------------

Eclipse ImageN is intended to meet the requirements of all of the different
imaging markets, and more. ImageN offers several advantages for
applications developers compared to other imaging solutions. Some of
these advantages are described in the following paragraphs.


### 1.3.1 Cross-platform Imaging

Whereas most imaging APIs are designed for one specific operating
system, ImageN follows the Java run time library model, providing
platform independence. Implementations of ImageN applications will run on
any computer where there is a Java Virtual Machine. This makes ImageN a
true cross-platform imaging API, providing a standard interface to the
imaging capabilities of a platform. This means that you write your
application once and it will run anywhere.


### 1.3.2 Distributed Imaging

Eclipse ImageN is also well suited for client-server imaging by way of the Java
platform\'s networking architecture and remote execution technologies.
Remote execution is based on Java RMI (remote method invocation). Java
RMI allows Java code on a client to invoke method calls on objects
that reside on another computer without having to move those objects
to the client.

*Eclipse ImageN continues to provide Java RMI support to help those migrating from JAI.*

### 1.3.3 Object-oriented API

Like Java itself, Eclipse ImageN is totally object-oriented. In Eclipse ImageN, images and
image processing operations are defined as objects. ImageN unifies the
notions of image and operator by making both subclasses of a common
parent.

An operator object is instantiated with one or more image sources and
other parameters. This operator object may then become an image source
for the next operator object. The connections between the objects
define the flow of processed data. The resulting editable graphs of
image processing operations may be defined and instantiated as needed.


### 1.3.4 Flexible and Extensible

Any imaging API must support certain basic imaging technologies, such
as image acquisition and display, basic manipulation, enhancement,
geometric manipulation, and analysis. ImageN provides a core set of the
operators required to support the basic imaging technologies. These
operators support many of the functions required of an imaging
application. However, some applications require special image
processing operations that are seldom, if ever, required by other
applications. For these specialized applications, ImageN provides an
extensible framework that allows customized solutions to be added to
the core API.

Eclipse ImageN also provides a standard set of image compression and
decompression methods. The core set is based on international
standards for the most common compressed file types. As with special
image processing functions, some applications also require certain
types of compressed image files. It is beyond the scope of any API to
support the hundreds of known compression algorithms, so ImageN also
supports the addition of customized coders and decoders (codecs),
which can be added to the core API.


### 1.3.5 Device Independent

The processing of images can be specified in device-independent
coordinates, with the ultimate translation to pixels being specified
as needed at run time. JAI\'s \"renderable\" mode treats all image
sources as rendering-independent. You can set up a graph (or chain) of
renderable operations without any concern for the source image
resolution or size; ImageN takes care of the details of the operations.

To make it possible to develop platform-independent applications, JAI
makes no assumptions about output device resolution, color space, or
color model. Nor does the API assume a particular file format. Image
files may be acquired and manipulated without the programmer having
any knowledge of the file format being acquired.


### 1.3.6 Powerful

JAI supports complex image formats, including images of up to three
dimensions and an arbitrary number of bands. Many classes of imaging
algorithms are supported directly, others may be added as needed.

JAI implements a set of core image processing capabilities, including
image tiling, regions of interest, and deferred execution. The API
also implements a set of core image processing operators, including
many common point, area, and frequency-domain operations. For a list
of the available operators, see [Section 3.6, \"Operators](../programming-environ).\"


### 1.3.7 High Performance

A variety of implementations are possible, including highly-optimized
implementations that can take advantage of hardware acceleration and
the media capabilities of the platform, such as MMX on Intel
processors and VIS on UltraSparc.


### 1.3.8 Interoperable

JAI is integrated with the rest of the Java Media APIs, enabling
media-rich applications to be deployed on the Java platform. ImageN works
well with other Java APIs, such as Java 3D and Java component
technologies. This allows sophisticated imaging to be a part of every
Java technology programmer\'s tool box.

JAI is a Java Media API. It is classified as a Standard Extension to
the Java platform. ImageN provides imaging functionality beyond that of
the Java Foundation Classes, although it is compatible with those
classes in most cases.


1.4 A Simple ImageN Program
---------------------------------------------

Before proceeding any further, let\'s take a look at an example 
program to get an idea of what it looks like. [Listing
1-1](../Introduction) shows a simple example of a complete
ImageN program. This example reads an image, passed to the program as a
command line argument, scales the image by 2x with bilinear
interpolation, then displays the result.
